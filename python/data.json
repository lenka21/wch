            "abstract": "Formulation of an advanced statistical theory of biochemical processes needs simple but adequate models of phenomena underlying microscopic dynamics of biomolecules, in particular enzymatic proteins. A synthetic picture of protein dynamics emerging from the recent studies is outlined and two classes of theoretical models of slow activated dynamics of conformational transitions within the native state are described. In models of the Protein-Glass type, successive conformational transitions are treated as diffusion of structural defects in liquid-like regions surrounding solid-like fragments of protein secondary structure. Alternatively, in models of the Protein-Machine type, the dynamics of conformational transitions is approximated by a quasi-continuous diffusive motion of solid-like structural elements relative to each other. A particular Protein-Machine model is applied in constructing a microscopic theory of enzymatic reaction involving a single chemical transformation of substrate. The rule seems to be that it is the process of conformational diffusion, and not the details of chemical transformation, that affects the rate of enzymatic reactions. Under this assumption the reaction pathways in the initial and stationary stages can differ. A possibility is indicated of direct coupling of several reactions taking place at the same multienzyme complex.",

The disruption of tertiary interaction, which associates the larger alterations, introduces local melting of protein structure. Chromonic liquid crystalline meso-phase entities of rod-like or ribbon-like supra-molecular organisation recognise and anchor to molten areas in b-pleated sheets, stabilising the altered conformation. This again produces higher stability for the ligand-protein complex and hence may be followed by increased activity or inhibition, opening the prospect for practical use of this phenomenon.",

The effective method for the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff base complexes involves an in situ approach wherein the presence of a metal ion in the cyclization reaction markedly increases the yield of the cyclic product. The metal ion plays an important role in directing the steric course of the reaction and this effect has been termed the metal-template effect. This article reviews the progress made in synthesis of metal ion complexes of Schiff base macrocycles through application of the above technique. The factors which prove to be of importance in directing the synthetic pathway in the Schiff base systems and must be taken into account in the design and synthesis of the desired products, are discussed.",

Methanol fuel cell seems to be promising for large-scale commercialization, in contrast to hydrogen-fed cells, especially in transportation. The limitation for methanol system is nowadays due to low catalytic activity of the electrodes, especially anodes. The best catalytic material seems to be platinum in composition with some other metals, as tin and ruthenium, which act as promotors of electrochemical processes. Promotors weaken the negative influence of catalyst poisons generated during the oxidation of methanol. Application of solid polymer electrolytes in methanol fuel cell allows to elevate the working temperature of the cell, which results in higher current densities. Methanol fuel cell presents several advantages: lack of toxic emission (CO, hydrocarbons, lead, sulphur), relatively low operating temperature.",

Initial Swedish results on extreme carcinogenicity of dioxine are compared with two series of German and American studies which do not confirm the early Swedish observations.\nCancer, birth defects, and other toxic effects are seen in animals only at doses close to those that cause overt toxic effects in adult animals. It is argued that humans have never been exposed to comparable exposure levels. Consequently, there is no convincing evidence for human cancer risk increase related to dioxin exposures.",

New techniques that have recently been extensively developed, such as the global energy minimization and quantum-classical dynamics methods, are also introduced.

A particularly important case is a diffusion-limited reaction with a time-dependent reaction rate coefficient, which in the initial stages is described by nonstationary solutions of the diffusion equations. In this paper an explicit form of an equation for the reaction rate coefficient, k(t), is given along with functions - obtained by using these equations - describing the decay of donor fluorescence in the presence of a quencher, I(t). It is also demonstrated how the dynamics of bimolecular processes may be studied by using dynamic measurements I(t) and/or Stern-Volmer kinetic curves.",

By-products resulting from reaction of organic and inorganic \"precursors\" in treated water containing bromides with strong oxidants: chlorine, ozone, chloramine and chlorine dioxide are described. The possible sources of bromide in natural waters, formation of bromine-containing by-products, health risk arising from their presence in drinking water, the technology of removal of these compounds from drinking water as well as analytical methods for their determination have been discussed.",

            "abstract": "Solid state NMR spectroscopy was used to study the structure and dynamics of phosphoroorganic dichalcogenes with general formula RR`P(S)XX(S)PRR` where X = S, Se. X-ray diffraction has revealed that the conformation of (S)PXXP(S) backbone depends on R, R` substituents and can adopt anti-anti, anti-syn, and syn-syn geometry. The interaction between p-electrons of X atoms and empty dxz and dyz orbials of phosphorus has influence on geometry of S = P-X unit. For anti-anti conformation the P-X distances are shorter and S = P-X angles smaller compared to syn-syn conformation. The changes of local environment of phosphorus were recognized by 31P CP/MAS experiment. The investigation of series of bis(organothiophosphoryl) disulfides has allowed to establish the relationship between 31P chemical shift parameters; anisotropy D, asymmetry h , principal elements of chemical shift tensor d and molecular structure of S=P-S-S-P=S fragment.\nThe question of correlation between the number of resonances in the isotropic part of spectrum and molecular symmetry established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction was discussed. Moreover, the 31P CP/MAS nad 77Se CP/MAS experiments for phosphoroorganic dichalcogenides were used to study different polymorphic forms, inclusion complexes, solvates as well as phase transitions below melting point. The deuterated solvents occluded in the crystal lattice of inclusion complexes were investigated by means of 1H-2H CP/MAS NMR technique.\nThe line-sharpe analysis of the \"Pake doublet\" for static 2H experiment and 13C CP/MAS technique were employed to investigation of the intermolecular dynamics of aliphatic and/or aromatic groups directly bonded to phosphorus.",
