            "abstract": "Formulation of an advanced statistical theory of biochemical processes needs simple but adequate models of phenomena underlying microscopic dynamics of biomolecules, in particular enzymatic proteins. a&nbsp;synthetic picture of protein dynamics emerging from the recent studies is outlined and two classes of theoretical models of slow activated dynamics of conformational transitions within the native state are described. In models of the Protein-Glass type, successive conformational transitions are treated as diffusion of structural defects in liquid-like regions surrounding solid-like fragments of protein secondary structure. Alternatively, in models of the Protein-Machine type, the dynamics of conformational transitions is approximated by a&nbsp;quasi-continuous diffusive motion of solid-like structural elements relative to each other. a&nbsp;particular Protein-Machine model is applied in constructing a&nbsp;microscopic theory of enzymatic reaction involving a&nbsp;single chemical transformation of substrate. The rule seems to be that it is the process of conformational diffusion, and not the details of chemical transformation, that affects the rate of enzymatic reactions. Under this assumption the reaction pathways in the initial and stationary stages can differ. a&nbsp;possibility is indicated of direct coupling of several reactions taking place at the same multienzyme complex.",

The disruption of tertiary interaction, which associates the larger alterations, introduces local melting of protein structure. Chromonic liquid crystalline meso-phase entities of rod-like or ribbon-like supra-molecular organisation recognise and anchor to molten areas in b-pleated sheets, stabilising the altered conformation. This again produces higher stability for the ligand-protein complex and hence may be followed by increased activity or inhibition, opening the prospect for practical use of this phenomenon.",

The effective method for the synthesis of macrocyclic Schiff base complexes involves an in situ approach wherein the presence of a&nbsp;metal ion in the cyclization reaction markedly increases the yield of the cyclic product. The metal ion plays an important role in directing the steric course of the reaction and this effect has been termed the metal-template effect. This article reviews the progress made in synthesis of metal ion complexes of Schiff base macrocycles through application of the above technique. The factors which prove to be of importance in directing the synthetic pathway in the Schiff base systems and must be taken into account in the design and synthesis of the desired products, are discussed.",

Methanol fuel cell seems to be promising for large-scale commercialization, in contrast to hydrogen-fed cells, especially in transportation. The limitation for methanol system is nowadays due to low catalytic activity of the electrodes, especially anodes. The best catalytic material seems to be platinum in composition with some other metals, as tin and ruthenium, which act as promotors of electrochemical processes. Promotors weaken the negative influence of catalyst poisons generated during the oxidation of methanol. Application of solid polymer electrolytes in methanol fuel cell allows to elevate the working temperature of the cell, which results in higher current densities. Methanol fuel cell presents several advantages: lack of toxic emission (CO, hydrocarbons, lead, sulphur), relatively low operating temperature.",

            "abstract": "Solid state NMR spectroscopy was used to study the structure and dynamics of phosphoroorganic dichalcogenes with general formula RR`P(S)XX(S)PRR` where X = S, Se. X-ray diffraction has revealed that the conformation of (S)PXXP(S) backbone depends on R, R` substituents and can adopt anti-anti, anti-syn, and syn-syn geometry. The interaction between p-electrons of X atoms and empty dxz and dyz orbials of phosphorus has influence on geometry of S = P-X unit. For anti-anti conformation the P-X distances are shorter and S = P-X angles smaller compared to syn-syn conformation. The changes of local environment of phosphorus were recognized by 31P CP/MAS experiment. The investigation of series of bis(organothiophosphoryl) disulfides has allowed to establish the relationship between 31P chemical shift parameters; anisotropy D, asymmetry h , principal elements of chemical shift tensor d and molecular structure of S=P-S-S-P=S fragment.\nThe question of correlation between the number of resonances in the isotropic part of spectrum and molecular symmetry established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction was discussed. Moreover, the 31P CP/MAS nad 77Se CP/MAS experiments for phosphoroorganic dichalcogenides were used to study different polymorphic forms, inclusion complexes, solvates as well as phase transitions below melting point. The deuterated solvents occluded in the crystal lattice of inclusion complexes were investigated by means of 1H-2H CP/MAS NMR technique.\nThe line-sharpe analysis of the \"Pake doublet\" for static 2H experiment and 13C CP/MAS technique were employed to investigation of the intermolecular dynamics of aliphatic and/or aromatic groups directly bonded to phosphorus.",

            "abstract": "One of the attractions of using enzymes for chemical synthesis is the control of stereochemistry, which results in optically active products. The other advantage is that only minimal protection-deprotection steps are involved. The possibility of using enzymes in non-aqueous media or biphasic mixtures of water and organic solvent increases the number of possible substrates which can be used. The main disadvantages of enzymes as catalysts in chemical syntheses are their rather high price, low stability at higher temperatures and extreme pH values. These, however, can be omitted or, at least, minimized by the use of crude preparations, by proper immobilization techniques or the use of the whole cells of microorganisms overproducing the desired enzyme. Enzymatic methods of the synthesis of the products of defined stereochemistry become more and more popular among chemists, being the most widely used for the preparation of optically pure a-amino acids. These compounds are finding increasing utility in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, production of agricultural products, food industry and material science. Selective synthesis of pure enantiomers of a-amino acids can be achieved by means of the enzymatic kinetic resolution of the racemic mixtures of D,L a-amino acids or its derivatives (namely by estrification, transestrification, acylation, oxidative deamination or hydrolysis) or enantiomerically catalysed condensation of achiral substrates. The purpose of this article is to review enzymatic methods used in the synthesis of a-amino acids in their optically active form and to present the most representative examples of this approach.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between electron donor power and electronic polarisability of oxide (-2) in somewhat indirect, and a&nbsp;more obvious method of measuring the electron donor power is to insert into material a&nbsp;\"probe\" which will respond directly to the donation of negative charge (see Fig.1) [5]. Such measurements can be made by using metal ions which exhibit the orbital expansion (nepheloauxetic) effect [19,20], particularly ions with s2 outer configuration such as Tl+, Pb2+ or Bi3+ [21,22]. This effect is illustrated in Fig.2 and applied to measure experimental optical basicity D (Eq. (5)) [23]. For many alkali and alkaline earth silicates, phosphates, borates (usually as glasses), and also certain other compounds D can be calculated. Among the parameters in the expression of D is the so-called \"basicity moderating parameter\", g [27,28]. It is noted that g increases roughly in line with electronegativity, except for the transition elements (cf. Fig. and Eq.(6)). Equation (8) is a&nbsp;general expression for the theoretical optical basicity, Dcal, of a&nbsp;system consisting of many oxide components. Hence Dcal is an ideal measure of the Lewis basicity, therefore it may be used as an indicator of structural changes in a&nbsp;vitreous system if contribution of one of the oxide components increases (Fig.4)[14]. Very often the basicity orders of various oxide systems show changes of their physical parameters (see Figs 5-9) [12, 13, 15, 16, 54].\nOn the other hand, experimental measures of the basicity, such as refractivity of the oxide species, Ro2- (Eq. 10) and so called Imagawa`s basicity, Gp o&nbsp;(Eq. (17) [40], are calculated. The former one is a&nbsp;measure of the basicity of all kinds of oxygen atoms in oxide systems and the latter measures the basicity of non-bridging oxides. Correlations optical basicity Dcal vs refractivity Ro2- as well Dcal vs Imagawa`s basicity Gp are illustrated in Figs 10 and 13, respectively [15, 16, 55]. Non-monotonic curves of the correlations show structural changes, as in sodium aluminosilicate vitreous system (Fig. 11) [14], or the mixed alkali effect in vitreous aluminosilicates (Figs 12 and 15) [12, 13, 54].",

For the first time such behaviour has been discovered by Stali\u0144ski in 1957 [1] in lanthanium-hydrogen system (see Fig. 1). Unfortunately, his bulk samples as a&nbsp;rule fall apart into powder severely limiting electrical and optical measurements. After 40 years, in 1996, the group of scientists from University of Amsterdam in a&nbsp;brilliant experiments showed the metal-to-semiconductor transition in the yttrium-hydrogen system. Working with a&nbsp;compact sample (thin films) of metal they performed the first real time visual observation of the transition from an yttrium metal to a&nbsp;semiconductor hydride of YH3. The YHx film changes from a&nbsp;shining mirror (YH2) to yellowish transparent window of YH3. It can be switched quickly, reversibly and without deterioration of the film. The changes in properties of YHx as a&nbsp;function of x have been obtained by subjecting a&nbsp;500 nm thick film of Y (with a&nbsp;20nm Pd protective layer) to 105 Pa of hydrogen gas at the room temperature. To investigate the properties of YHx film for 0< x < 2.86 the electrical resistivity and light transmission measurements (1 eV < Eph < 3.2 eV) have been on-line performed during hydrogen absorption (see Fig. 3).\nIn this review the most likely electronic band structure scheme important for the understanding of the basic features of the metalhydrides is also presented (see Fig. 2).\nThe spectacular changes in optical properties from perfectly refllecting pure yttrium into an essentially non-reflecting and transparent YH2.86 film might lead to new technological applications of rare earth metal-hydride film.",

            "abstract": "The paper describes methods of preparation of aluminum hydroxides and oxides with nanosized particles of different morphology.\nFibrillar ALOOH is prepared by autoclaving basic aluminum salts or aluminum hydroxides solutions in the presence of acids under hydrothermal conditions (at elevated temperatures for appropriate times). The synthesis conditions which principally affect the character of the product obtained are: acid used and its concentration, concentration of aluminum and its ratio to acid, operating temperature and temperature-time relation. An unusual characteristic of such products is that the ultimate particles consist of fibrills about 5 nm in diameter and over 100 nm long, each consisting of a&nbsp;crystal of boehmite. Fibrillar alumina have properties of high surface area with attendant adsorptive and ion exchange characteristics, chemical stability, refraction nature and good film-formation properties.\nThe raw materials for preparation of aluminum hydroxides with quasi-spheroidal particles about 3-100 nm in diameter are aluminum alkoxides. During the process, alkoxides are hydrolyzed and the resultant hydroxide is peptized to a&nbsp;clear sol. The sol then must be gelled and pyrolyzed to 500 <sup>o</sup>C to obtain the porous transparent Al2O3. Other properties are: a&nbsp;linear thermal expansion, capability of being formed as thin films or in bulk and thermal stability up to ~ 1200 <sup>o</sup>C at which temperature in nondestructively converts to a-Al2O3.\nNonstructured aluminum hydroxides and oxides can be also prepared as a&nbsp;result of rehydration of active transition aluminas. Transition aluminas are obtained by fast calcination of gibbsite at temperatures up to 800<sup>o</sup>C. As a&nbsp;consequence of fast calcination, carred out in less than 3 s, a&nbsp;highly amorphous product is obtained which is a&nbsp;mixture of aluminum oxides (r-, c-, g-) and boehmite. That product can be easily rehydrated with simultaneous changes in particle morphology and phase composition. By selecting appropriate rehydration parameters, i.e., temperature and time, characteristic particle structure - in a&nbsp;form of needles and plates - can be obtained. After drying and calcining, aluminum oxides with increased specific surface and decreased bulk density can be produced. The particle morphology is conserved after calcination at temperatures up to 1000<sup>o</sup>C.\nThe nanocrystalline aluminum materials form mechanically and thermally stable systems that can be obtained as highly dispersed powders, thin films or solids. They are interesting materials for preparation of active matrixes - inorganic as well as organic components can be easily incorporated to such systems.

The crystals were grown from aqueous solutions. The IR-, Raman and electron absorption spectra are discussed on the basis of possible symmetries of the dopant ion. The vibrational and vibronic assignments of the spectral frequencies were proposed. The results indicate that the complex ion is trapped in two nonequivalent symmetries, D2h and Cs, which have been identified and characterised by the < g >, E and D, of the spin Hamiltonian and D and B crystal field parameters. The D2h center represents extremely rare case with E/D very close to 1/3. The interaction between the trapped ion and associated vacancies is discussed and compared for all studied systems. The comparison of some spectroscopic parameters such as D, D, n6 and unit cell parameter of the hosts is given. In the halide series the observed parameters change almost linearly with the lattice dimension. Vibronic analysis of the emission spectra indicates that n8 mode is most efficient in the radiationless transitions of the 2Eg state.",

The phase covers a&nbsp;certain compositional interval within the Bi2O3-Bi2O5-La2O3 ternary system, being defined by the substitution parameter 0 \u00a3 x < 1/8 and the average valency of Bi ions 3 \u00a3 Bi < 5. Within this domain of homogeneity the phase can exhibit three different but closely related polymorphic forms, namely: rhombohedral, monoclinic, and triclinic. Only the monoclinic form is stable in air in the whole temperature range. The rhombohedral form transforms to the monoclinic one; most efficiently for x=0. This structure transformation is irreversible and becomes noticeable in air at, and above 900 oC. The new triclinic form (space group , a&nbsp;= 3,921 (1) \u00c5, b = 4,024 (1) \u00c5, c = 5,623 (1) \u00c5, a= 87,62 (1)o, b= 90,32 (1)o, g= 90,09 (1)o develops from the monoclinic one when the latter is oxidized to the level given by Bi \u00b3+4. This process is fully reversible. Oxidation of the rhombohedral form preserves its structure type and seems not to induce any structure transformation. As in the case of the monoclinic form, the process is accompanied by an effective increase of Bi > +4. Both oxidized forms are stable in air but not higher than up to 300-350 oC. Above this temperature they release oxygen with a&nbsp;maximum speed at ca 400<sup>o</sup>C and retransform back to the appropriate starting structures.",

Relativistic effects, together with specific effects coming from f oritals, lead to some irregularities in properties of elements from the lower region of the periodic table.

            "abstract": "The reactions that link several transformations together in a&nbsp;single synthetic step are called domino or tandem reactions. Domino reaction is a&nbsp;process invglving two or more bond-forming transformations which take place under the same reaction condations. According to the mechanism of the first step, one can distinguish between a&nbsp;cationic, anionic, radical pericyclic and transition-metal induced transformations. Combination of reactions of the same mechanism is called homo-domino reaction, whareas a&nbsp;sequence of reactions with different mechanism is callad hetero-domino reactions [2].\nThe cationic reaction involves the formation of carbocation which then reacts with nucleophile to form a&nbsp;new carbocation that undergoes one or more further transformations finally being trapped by a&nbsp;nucleophile or being stabilized by elimination of a&nbsp;proton. The axample of the cationic-domino reaction of biological importance is the cyclotetramerization of porphobilinogen [6], the biosynthetic precursor of protoheme, chlorophyll and vitamin B12 (Schema 2).\nIn anionic-domino reactions the primary step is the formation of an anion or a&nbsp;nucleophile. The majority of cases involve the deprotonation of CH group and formation of a&nbsp;carbanion which subsequently reacts with activated alkenes to produce new anionic intermediates. The large fraction of anionic processes involve either a&nbsp;Michael-initiated or a&nbsp;Michael-terminated process and generate a&nbsp;cyclic structure. Anionic-domino reactions were often used in the total synthesis of many natural products, e.g. corynanthe alkaloids [19], (Scheme 15).\nIn radical-domino reactions the formation of the primary radicals can result by reaction of halogens or from phenylthio and phenylselenyl compounds with stannanes and redox processes involving manganese compounds. In this area Snider et al. [20] have used manganese triacetate for the synthesis of tricyclic ketone (Scheme 16).\nPericyclic-domino reactions such as the Diels-Alder or electrocyclic reactions were widely used for the synthesis of complex molecules. The combination of two or more domino-Diels-Alder reactions was found to be useful procedure for the synthesis of pagodane [26], (Scheme 23). The tandem Diels-Alder reaction and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition were used for the synthesis of pyrrolizidine [29], a&nbsp;structural unit of several biological active alkaloids (Scheme 26).\nAn example of hetero-domino reactions are the anionic-pericyclic sequences of transformation, e.g. the Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. These types of transformations can be performed as a&nbsp;two-components reaction of a&nbsp;three-components reaction (Scheme 27, 28). The tandem Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels-Alder reactions were applied by Tietze et al. [2, 32] for the synthesis of various alkaloids (Scheme 30).\nRecently domino reactions have gained wide acceptance, because they increase synthetic efficiency by decreasing the number of laboratory operations required and the quantities of chemicals and solvents used.",

            "abstract": "The interference in the insect methamorphosis can be applied as a&nbsp;tool for insect pests population control. The development of Williams`s idea [2] of using the insect juvenile hormone analogues for this purpose afforded juvenoids 2,3 and 4 which are used in practice. The finding of agents which would be able to decrease juvenile hormone level in larvae was the next conception for obtaining a&nbsp;new class of insecticides. Such approach had led Bowers [1, 10] to discovery of precocene i&nbsp;(6) and precocene II (7), which induce precocious metamorphosis larvae in immature insects. The mode of action of precocenes involves the formation of highly reactive 3,4-epoxy derivatives in the corpora allata glands. These unstable intermediates react with surrounding proteins causing the necrotic atrophy of the corpora allata. The presentation of different types of analogues of precocenes is given in this paper. The data of biological tests carried out for some precocene analogues showed that the aromatic character of the molecule and the presence of 3,4-double bond are crucial for the appearance of the anti-juvenile activity, whereas the presence of the methoxy group is not essential for this activity [41]. The decreasing of the juvenile hormones level can be also achieved by disturbing their biosynthesis. Compounds which inhibit this biosynthesis in its earlier steps (25, 26, 27), and in the final, epoxidation step (28, 29, 30) are considered as anti-juvenile agents, too. The compounds with anti-juvenile activity for which the mode of action is unknown (33, 34, 35) [48, 59] are presented in the last paragraph of this article.",

            "abstract": "The concept of biogeochemical cycles is fundamental to proper understanding of the status of chemical elements in the nature. a&nbsp;biogeochemical cycle results from the integration of several biological, chemical and physical processes. All microorganisms carry out many unique reactions of geochemical significance [1].\nBiogeochemistry is a&nbsp;multidisciplinary science. The relationships between the different sciences, which are represented by circles, can be illustrated by a&nbsp;diagram on Fig. 1.\nManganese is the second most abundant transition metal after iron in the earth`s crust. The cycling and movement of iron and manganese in natural systems depend on their redox chemistries. Eh-pH stability diagrams for manganese and iron at 25<sup>o</sup>C and activity of 10-5 M have been derived from thermodynamic data (Fig. 2).\nMicroorganisms have been implicated in transformations of both manganese and iron in soils and aquatic environments. Tab. 1 includes a&nbsp;list of both iron and manganese-oxidizing and -reducing microorganisms. Several different mechanisms have been proposed for the transformation of both manganese and iron from one valence state to another by microorganisms. The process of enzymatically catalyzed iron biooxidation by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacteria is illustrated by a&nbsp;scheme at Fig. 3. The mechanism of microbial formation of oxidized manganese minerals in aquatic environments has been described. Environmental conditions of pH, Ep, Mn(II) and Fe(III) concentrations and temperature have a&nbsp;strong influence on the form of manganese minerals [7]. Manganese minerals (todorokite, birnessite) observed in marine sediments and nodules are of microbial origin.\nMarine ferromanganese nodules contain significant concentration of cobalt, some of rare earth elements, and other trace elements (Tab. 2). Bacteriological investigations of ferromanganese nodules indicate that the microbial populations are complicated [14]. Ocean-floor manganese nodules have recently attracted considerable interest as a&nbsp;source of such important metals as nickel, copper, cobalt, manganese and many more. a&nbsp;number of processes that follow pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical routes have been reported [14-17]. However, the hydrometallurgical processing routes are considered to be more economical. The results of leaching experiments with the use of dilute hydrochloric acid, ammonia and ammonium sulphate solutions are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Present state of understanding of the mechanism of the hydrogen-ene reaction when the enophile is singlet oxygen is discussed. Allyl hydroperoxides are important species both from the chemical and biological points of view. They are formed when an alkene reacts with singlet oxygen [2, 7, 8] and there is good evidence from stereochemical and hydrogen isotope studies that this reaction proceeds through an intermediate ene-enophile complex, which then undergoes internal hydrogen transfer [17-19]. The reaction usually gives a&nbsp;single allylic isomer. In 1958, Schenck [9] showed that 5a-D6 - hydroperoxide which is formed by the singlet oxygenation of cholesterol rearranged in a&nbsp;non-polar solvent to the 7a-D5 - hydroperoxide. Presumably rearrangements of this type are as ubiquitous as the hydroperoxides themselves but, despite the importance of these systems, these reactions are only poorly recognised and even less understood. Only some ten examples of the rearrangement have as yet been recognised, and half of these relate to congeners of cholesterol. In general, the products of singlet oxygenation appear to rearrange to the products of triplet oxygenation. The reaction is well established to involve the intermediate radicals, but the detailed mechanism is still a&nbsp;matter of speculation [11-15]. It has been found that singlet oxygen and allyl hydroperoxides formed in cells of our bodies have toxic properties and they are known to cause several diseases. However, vitamins C, E and a&nbsp;act as natural antioxidants. Some medical aspects of the mentioned above problems are discussed. Skin injuries as bruises, overcolourings and blisters are very often caused by reactions of singlet oxygen generated in our bodies by a&nbsp;solar radiation [1, 29]. Singlet oxygen may be also produced by stimulated phagocytes, mainly in catalysed reactions [31-33]. Peroxidation of lipids is assumed as a&nbsp;main source of toxic properties of singlet oxygen metabolites [1]. Recently, researchers focused their attention on toxic properties of the oxidized LDL fraction [34-36]. Oxidation of LDL is an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [37-41]. However, the reactivity of singlet oxygen may be applied in treatment of herpes, jaundice of infants and psoriasis [1].",

The directed graph (Fig.1), unoriented graphs (Fig. 2) and the concepts of adjacency and incidence (Fig. 3) are presented and defined [18-21]. The topological approach to the structure of organic molecules is described. Graphs, adequately labelled, may be associated with several matrices. a&nbsp;graph G is labelled if a&nbsp;certain numbering of vertices of G is introduced. Here two graph-theoretical matrices, i.e., the adjacency matrix [18-22] and the distance matrix [18, 21-24] are discussed. They are also referred to as topological matrices. The distance matrix for molecules with heteroatoms includes the diagonal elements (eq. (5)) and the off-diagonal elements (eqs. (6), (7)) which are shown in Tabs 2 and 3, respectively [21, 24]. The distances for particular paths for building the distance matrix for cis (Z) and trans (E) isomers are listed in Tab.5 [72].

            "abstract": "Chemical compounds, including pesticides, are the major contaminants in water, soil and food [1-4], bringing about the incidence of poisoning and various forms of allergy [5-9]. Due to numerous applications of herbicides in agriculture [10,11], new and better methods for their determination are constantly searched for [12].\nIn the present study, we deal with s-triazine derivatives (formulas I-III and Tab.1) which are slightly soluble in water, readily excreted from the organism and characterised by relatively low toxicity (Tab. 2) [13]. These herbicides are determined still by HPLC, GC and TLC methods [2, 14-16] which are very effective but require an expensive and modern equipment. Therefore, in the seventies, researches started to use the TLC method in combination with the inhibition phenomena of enzymatic processes [17-20]. These studies are continued [21,22] although in the nineties, immunoassays were used for the analysis of water and food. These methods have gained great appreciation due to the fact that they are equally sensitive as HPLC and GC methods, but they also allow one to determine a&nbsp;given compound selectively among many others without any sample separation and concentration.The immunochemical procedures may be defined as methods which utilise the reaction of bonding between antibody and antigen, with one of the process components being a&nbsp;tracer (fluorescence label, isotope or enzyme). There are qualitative methods such as the immunomorphological ones and quantitative such as the immunoassays [23], as shown in Fig.1.\nIn the immunoenzymatic methods, the tracer is an enzyme, while the spectrophotometric measurement of the substrate colour is a&nbsp;quantitative measure of the process. The most popular is the indirect method known as ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) in which an antibody or antigen is immobilised on a&nbsp;solid substrate. This method has been used for several years to determine pesticides in water, soil and food [24]. The sensitivity of the ELISA method can be increased by such factors as the type of solid substrate used (magnetic particles [25-30], microplates [31], modified silicone capillaries [32-35], the use of suitable enzyme as tracer [32,36] and the use of an appropriate antibody [36-44] which is selectively linked with the given antigen.\nIt has been shown in papers [25-30] that the use of magnetic particles makes it possible to detect pesticides in quantities at a&nbsp;level of several ppb (Tab. 3) in water and soil. These are the quantities comparable with those determined by conventional methods, with the correlation coefficient of both methods being close to unity. The recovery of atrazine [31] by the ELISA method with the use of magnetic particles is the same as that in the case of using microplates (Tab. 4). The sensitivities of both methods are also comparable, although the scatter of results is lower in the first method.\nThe literature review and our experimental studies [24] have shown that ELISA methods are suitable for the examination of toxic components in water, soil and food, and, moreover, they can successfully replace the methods used so far. They are relatively easy in use and characterised by a&nbsp;high sensitivity and specificity. The relatively short time required to carry out the analysis makes it possible to use these methods to test raw materials and final products, as well as to inspect the course of technological processes.",

            "abstract": "The description of the molecular topology in terms of graph theory is one of the most important aspects of chemical information handling and retrieval. There are two main groups of methods for representation of molecular constitution: linear notations and topological systems. This review presents the history and current trends of topological systems, and their application in existing data bases and computational software.\nIn this article we refer to topological systems as connection table or matrix representations (and their enhancements) of the topology of chemical substances as contrasted with their representation as linear sequence of symbols (called the linear notation).\nThe earliest reference to the use of connection-table representations of structure is that of Wheland [4,5], who has shown that acetaldehyde, for example, could be represented as well by a&nbsp;table of the form of Tab. 2 as by the diagrams a-c (Fig. 1). In 1951, Mooers [6] suggested that a&nbsp;chemical structure could conveniently be represented as a&nbsp;tabulation of atoms and bonds. In 1962, Meyer and Wenke [9] employed a&nbsp;six-column table, the columns of which had the significance shown in Tab. 3. The tabular representations of structure developed by Meyer and Wenke are substantially similar to those developed later by Gluck and his colleagues at DuPont [17,18]. About the same time as the work of Meyer and Wenke, Spialter [11] reported a&nbsp;\"new unambiguous universal symbolism\" for chemical compounds which he called the Atom Connectivity Matrix (ACM). The ACM is exactly analogous to Wheland`s matrix, except that the atom symbols are placed along the principal diagonal, rather than at the heads of columns and rows. The off-diagonal symbols of the ACM can contain bond symbols or other features of structure as desired. Other papers worth to be mentioned of that period are those of Ray and Kirsch [7] from the National Bureau of Standards; Oppler and Norton [8] from the Dow Chemical Company; Dyson, Cossum, Lynch and Morgan [15] and the most important one of Morgan [16] at Chemical Abstracts Service.\nFurther enhancements of representations of structures can be divided into a&nbsp;several groups:\n(a) a&nbsp;compression of information stored in a&nbsp;connection table. a&nbsp;good example can be the connectivity stack proposed by Kudo and Sasaki [19], which is a&nbsp;sequence of elements of the connectivity matrix, obtained by application of special correspondence rules.\n(b) Changing the type of data stored within graph vertices and edges. The development in this area is the most spectacular. The main achievements are the Chemical Abstracts Service registry system [20]; the Block-Cutpoint and Extended Block-Cutpoint trees by Hakayama and Fujiwara [21, 22]; Reduced Graphs described by Lynch et al. [25] for the GENSAL project; Fragment Connection Table [28] used in the Beilstein system and the Two-Level Compact Connectivity Tables of Wentang et al. [30].\n(c) a&nbsp;replacement tables and matrices by more effective data structures, like e.g. incidence lists, what was applied for the machine storage for a&nbsp;Weighted Oriented Bond-Valence graphs [32].",

In addition, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) as the pollutants are usually present at very low concentrations, so their detection and quantitation require a&nbsp;preconcentration step. This paper describes the enrichment methods that may be used for sampling and measuring of nonmethane hydrocarbons in ambient air. The range of sample collection methods for NMHCs in ambient air has diversified over recent years. Sampling methods now include: passivated canisters, pumped air sampling onto sorbent tubes, diffusive (passive) monitoring, on-line air sampling and analysis. Also cryogenic techniques: cryogenic focusing (CF) and cryogenic trapping (CT) have been reported. These two techniques are becoming more prevalent in today`s chromatography laboratory as very sensitive separation techniques. Gas chromatography with FID, PID or MS detection is the most often used analytical technique of determination of NMHCs in the air samples. Applications of different methods of sampling with preconcentration and the review of GC columns used for NMHCs separation have been presented. However, there are certain problems connected with each sampling procedure (air moisture, artefact formation, stability of samples, loss reactions).",

            "abstract": "a-Amino acids are among most important compounds in living organisms. Amino acids are not only constituents of peptides and proteins but they play an important role in many reactions in living cells. There are many excellent methods of the asymmetric synthesis of a-amino acids, but only some of them are versatile. In this work we have reviewed and presented the most versatile methods, giving the best chemical yield and optical purity of the final products.\nOne of the oldest and still useful synthetic route to racemic a-amino acids is Strecker's method [3], (Scheme 1). Modification of the method by Weinges et al. [8-11], (Scheme 2) allowed to obtain pure enantiomers of a-amino acids in high yields.\nNext important group of the methods applies \"glycine anion equivalent\". In this group, \"bislactim-ether method of Schollkopf et al. [13-21], (Scheme 3 and Tab. 1) has to be mentioned at first because of the high chemical yield of the transformation and optical purity of the final amino acid. The same type of methodology was employed by Seebach et al., in their method utilizing oxazolidinones or imidazolidinones [22-26], (Schemes 4, 5 and Tab. 2). Yield and enantiometric excess (ee) of the final amino acid in the method of Seebach et al., is very high (in most cases >80%). The only inconvenience is connected with drastic conditions of final hydrolysis. The similar, good results were also obtained in methods utilizing enolates obtained from oxazinones [29-31], (Schemes 6-8 and Tabs 3, 4).\nDerivatives of the oxazynones were also applied as \"glycine cation equivalent\" in the method in which \"the chiral cation\" reacts with nucleophiles [32, 33], (Scheme 9 and Tab. 5) with the high chemical yield and ee of the final product.\nThe similar procedures were used in an alkylation of a&nbsp;chiral Schiff base. The best yield and optical purity of the final a-amino acid were obtained by Oppolzer et al. [35,36], who applied a&nbsp;derivative of glycine attached to bornane-10,2-sultam (the derivative of camphor), (Schemes 13,14).\nThe next group of synthetic procedures is based on a&nbsp;reaction of the ring openning of b-lactones obtained from serine [41-43], (Scheme 16) or threonine [44], and aziridines [45-48], (Scheme 17). a&nbsp;nucleophile attack on the b-carbon of the substrate gives amino acid with modified side chain. Despite of high yield and ee, a&nbsp;selection of possible nucleophiles is limited.\nAnother important methodology is called \"electrophilic amination\". In this procedure a&nbsp;chiral enolate obtained from N-acyl-oxazolidinone [50,52], (Schemes 18, 19) or N-acyl-sultam [51, 53], (Scheme 21) is aminated either by di-tert-butyl-azodicarboxylate (DBAD), [50, 51], trisyl azide [52], or 1-chloro-1-nitrozo-cyclohexane [53]. Yield of these reactions are high and ee exeeds 95%.\nContrary to the \"electrophilic\", a&nbsp;\"nucleophilic amination\" requires a&nbsp;\"cation equivalent\" obtained from a&nbsp;chiral N-acyl-derivatives [54-55]. The reaction usualy yields a&nbsp;desired product of good enantiometric quality. In most cases azide anion is a&nbsp;source of \"nucleophilic amine equivalent\" (Schemes 22 and 23). The chiral 2,3-epoxy-1-ols can be also applied in this methodology [57, 58], (Scheme 24).\nAsymmetric catalytic hydrogenation of a&nbsp;dehydro derivatives of amino acids and peptides is the another valuable group of synthetic routes to the single enantiomer of the amino acid. There is possibility of heterogenous and homogenous catalysis involving insoluble catalysts [60, 61], (Schemes 27, 28) in medium of the reaction. The best results (yield nearly100% and ee equal or greate then 99%) were reported for the complexes of Rh with chiral phosphines ligands like BINAP or DIPAMP (Scheme 28), [67].\nThe last method reported in our review is based on usage of anzymes. The most widely used in this field are the following anzymes: acylases - catalizing stereoselective removal or synthesis of N-acyl derivatives [70], (Scheme 30) and proteases - catalyzing hydrolysis or synthesis of esters [71], (Scheme 31). Additionally, anzymatic methods give many cases both enantiomers at the same time.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to review the most widely used technique for studies of fast bimolecular reactions - Time Correlated Single Photon Counting Technique (TCSPCT). The TCSPCT has become one of the most powerful tools to investigate the fluorescence time behavior. The most prominent point of this method is the use of time-resolved fluorescence quenching as a&nbsp;method for studying diffusion-controlled reactions. The experimentally measured fluorescence decay D(t) is the convolution of the instrument response function E(t) and the fluorescence decay function I(t). The problem to solve is simply to determine the function I(t) when both D(t) and E(t) are known. In practice, however, the problem is highly complicated due to severe experimental distortions and correlations between adjusted parameters. In this paper we have attempted to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of TCSPCT under various conditions in determining the fluorescence quenching kinetics. To investigate fluorescence quenching using SCK theory it is essential to determine the values of R, D and k, because these parameters describe the rate coefficient of the reaction between the excited donor and the quencher - k(t). D represents the sum of the diffusion coefficients and R the sum of the radii of the donor in the electronic excited state and of the quencher respectively, and k, represents the specific rate constant. However, from the point of view of the fluorescence decay measurement, it is necessary to determine the values of t0, S, G0 and tr, where G0 is a&nbsp;scaling factor. In this paper particular emphasis is placed on the method enabling the determination of the numerical values of E(t) or the elimination of it from the procedure of data fitting according to SCK theory. Table 1 summarises details of experiment when the TCSPCT was employed to study kinetics of fast bimolecular reactions by observation of fluorescence quenching.",

            "abstract": "The most basic difference between crystalline and non-crystalline solids is that a&nbsp;long range order (LORO) in the distribution of atoms (ions) or molecules exists only in crystalline materials [1]. This is indicated by diffraction patterns: the ideal crystal (the first extreme case) shows reflectans whose location and intensity obey three Laue conditions. The second extreme case is an ideally random structure. Scattering of radiation is impossible in the case of an ideally homogenous medium. Any real substance, including non-crystalline materials, is inhomogenous regardless of its form or scale. Thus glasses can be thought of as assemblies of microcrystals (i.e. microcrystallites or paracrystals). Strain introduced due to lattice mismatch at grain boundaries, the presence of a&nbsp;disordered interfacial or matrix region, and defects such as dislocations, or stacking faults can be assumed to give rise to departures from periodicity at distances smaller than the average grain size [10]. In this sense glasses are interesting in the supramolecular science because they are intermediate objects in the way from random to organized matter [5].\nThe object of this article are such amorphous materials as inorganic oxide glasses with structural groups YO4 , where Y = Si, P, and organicallly modified silicate gels. Among the studied glasses are ones of the type: R2O-SiO2 and R2O-Al2O3-SiO2, where R represents alkali atom (Li to Cs) [23, 25, 27], as well as M(II)O-P2O5, where M(II) is an alkaline earth atom (Mg to Ba) [28, 29, 32, 33]. Undoped glasses and those doped with copper(II) ions were investigated. These metal ions have played the role of probes.\nAll the vitreous systems are classified according to their theoretical optical basicity Dcal proposed by Duffy and Ingram [34]. Thanks to this method one can methodically observe and sensibly interpret changes of real measures of basicity as molar refractivity of oxide ions Ro (see Figs. 9 and 10a), the so called Imagawa's basicity (Fig. 10b) and other physical and chemical properties of oxide glasses (Fig. 11). The studied glasses are also classified according to their bond nature (Fig. 6), taking into account their proximity to the onset of metallization [41]. Attention is also focused on the mixed alkali effect [22, 24].\nA full understanding of the properties of colloids calls upon a&nbsp;wide range of physical and chemical ideas, while the multitude of colloidal systems presented to us in nature, and familiar in modern society, exhibits a&nbsp;dauting complexity. On the experimental side there is an ever-increasing emphasis on the application of modern physical techniques to colloidal problems. Colloid science is thus a&nbsp;truly interdisciplinary subject [3].\nIn the case of the xerogels there are described Cu(II) complexes existing on surface and in interior of the material [59-63]. Moreover, silica xerogels with immobilized supramolecular ligands show intensive luminescence (Fig. 17) which are effectively quenched by Cu(II) ions [64].",

            "abstract": "This paper is devoted to organic thiosulfates, so called Bunte salts. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Hans Bunte`s birth (1848), the short biographical note was annexed. The main, historical method of synthesis of organic thiosulfate was described with some novel modifications [3-11]. In Figures 1 and 2 the general structure of Bunte salts and the mentioned reaction are shown respectively. Newer methods of synthesis like, for example, the addition of thiosulfate anion to alkenes or oxiranes are presented in Figs 3 and 5 [2,12,13,18,19].\nIn the next chapter some chemical properties of Bunte salts were described. Aqueous solutions of these compounds are unstable. In acid medium they hydrolyse to thiols, while in basic one to appropriate disulfides (Figs 6,7) [3,10, 22-26]. The reaction of dihalides with sodium thiosulfate leads to \"double\" Bunte salts carrying two thiosulfate end groups. It was found that in presence of NaOH or H2O2 these salts give appropriate polydisulfides [8, 9]. The scheme of this process is shown in Figure 11. It was found that anodic oxidation of Bunte salts leads also to di- and polydisulfides [7].\nUsually, organic sulphur compounds shown strong biological activity. There are a&nbsp;few examples of biological studies on organic thiosulfates in the literature. The sodium ethylthiosulfate, originally prepared by Bunte [3], exhibits a&nbsp;striking synergistic effect with the bacteriostatic 2-mercaptobenzothiazole against Staphylococcus aureus and tubercle bacillus [43, 44]. Sodium salt of the aromatic 3-nitrophenylthiosulfate was reported to show strong preventive and curative activity against fowl coccidiosis [22]. Radioprotective properties of heterocyclic derivatives of thiosulfates were also investigated [48]. The chemical structure of Bunte salt anions carrying a&nbsp;long aliphatic chain suggests their amphiphilic character. It is known that amphiphility of numerous quaternary ammonium salts is responsible for their ability to damage cell membranes. We paid our attention to the relationship between the chemical structure and the antibacterial and fungicidal activity of a&nbsp;number of known and newly synthesised Bunte salts [7]. The results of this work are presented in Figure 13. Many Bunte salts have excellent technical applications described in the patents cited [42-49].",

The chemical industry undertakes many activities to meet the requirements of environmental protection. Two from amongst the environmental management techniques, i.e., Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) [10] and Risk Assessment [13-15] are described and discussed in this paper. LCA studies the environmental aspects and potential impacts throughout a&nbsp;product's life from raw material acquisition through production, use, and disposal. Risk assessment is a&nbsp;formalized analysis of the adverse impact of some specific material, chemical, or procedure on humans and/or the environment. Examples of life cycle inventory (LCI which is part of LCA) for detergent alcohols production [12] and risk assessment for detergent surfactants use [21] are given.\nFinally, some new types of chemodegradable surfactants are described. This term has been used since 1988 [22, 23] to describe \"hydrolyzable\" [24, 25], \"cleavable\" [26, 27], and \"destructible\" [27] surfactants that contain in their molecules at least one functional group susceptible to chemical reactions in aqueous environment (Scheme 1). In such reactions, surface active substances lose their chemical identity and, in many cases, surface properties as well. In this respect, chemodegradability is similar to primary biodegradability because a&nbsp;surface active substance is degraded in these processes to an extent that is environmentally acceptable [28]. This paper reports the synthesis of chemodegradable surfactants bearing in their molecules an ester or an acetal function, the latter beeing represented by cyclic 1,3-dioxolane or 1,3-dioxane structure (Scheme 3).",

            "abstract": "Nickel is now well recognized as an essential ultra trace element for bacteria and plants, where five distinct types of Ni-containing enzymes have been identified. It is also considered to be essential for animals and humans, however its role in animal biochemistry is not well defined.\nThe article, containing 10 figures and 201 bibliographic positions, provides a&nbsp;current summary of the properties of known nickel enzymes, with emphasis on structure-function relations. In the begining the paper reviews accurrence of Ni in environment, and its biological importance. The relevant chemistry of nickel complexes has been shortly reviewed.\nNickel enzymes are particularly prominent in the metabolism of anaerobic bacteria. For example, the metabolism of methanogens involves methyl-CoM reductase, nickel hydrogenase, aceryl-CoA synthase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. Important enzyme for many bacteria, fungi, and plants is urease. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, to form ammonia and carbamate. It was the first enzyme ever to be crystallized (Sumner J. B., J.Biol. Chem., 1926, 69, 435; ibid., 1926, 70, 97). In 1975 Dixon and co-workers discovered that urease contain nickel at the active site (Dixon N. F. et al., J.Am. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97, 4131). Twenty years later the X-ray crystal structure of the urease from Klebsiella aerogenes has been determined (Jabri E. et al., Science, 1995, 268, 998). The enzyme is an (a b g3 trimer with each a-subunit having an (ab)3-barrel domain containing a&nbsp;binickel active site. a&nbsp;carbamylated lysine provides an oxygen ligand to each nickel, explaining why carbon dioxide is required for the activation of urease apoenzyme (Park I.S.,Hausinger R.P., Science, 1995, 267, 1156). In the paper the coordination geometry of nickel ions and the structure of active site, together with possible catalytic mechanism, are presented.\n[NiFe]-hydrogenases catalyze the two electron redox chemistry of H2. Crystallographic data on the hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas were presented (Volbeda et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 12989), giving a&nbsp;new information on the structure and mode of action of its H2, activating place. The active center was found to contain a&nbsp;heterodinuclear active site composed of a&nbsp;Ni center bridged to an Fe center by cysteinate ligands, and by oxygen species, which is proposed to be signature of the inactive form of the enzyme. The iron atom binds three diatomic ligands, which are nonexchangeble triply bonded molecules (probably CO, CN- or NO). Based on the new structure possible modes of hydrogen binding and catalytic action of the active site are discussed.\nMethyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes the final stage of the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane in methanogenic bacteria. The terminal step involves prosthetic group, Factor 430 (F-430), which in the resting state is a&nbsp;nickel(II) tetrapyrrole. Studies of F-430 in the enzyme complex suggest a&nbsp;hexacoordinate, octahedral Ni(II) environment, with two oxygen axial ligands. The spectral data of the active form of MCR are characteristic for F-430 in the Ni(I) oxidation state (Goubeaud M. et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1997, 243, 110), indicating that methyl-CoM reductase is activated when the enzyme-bound coenzyme F-430 is reduced to the Ni(I) state. The macrocycle can readily accomodate the structural changes, that accompany reduction Ni(II) to Ni(I).\nCarbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) catalyze the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2, at an active site, called the cluster C, composed of an [4Fe-4S] cube with pentacoordinate Fe (called FCII, linked to a&nbsp;Ni (Hu Z. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 830). Besides the enzymes that contain only CODH activity, there are the bifunctional enzymes that contain both CODH, and acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) activity (Ragsdale S. W., Kumar M., Chem, Rev., 1996, 96, 2515). This enzyme catalyzes reaction of CO at two separate Ni-FeS clusters. Oxidation of CO to CO2 is catalyzed by cluster C, while incorporation of CO into acetyl-CoA occurs at cluster A. a&nbsp;model of catalysis is proposed.",

            "abstract": "The Mitsunobu reaction has been known since the late sixties. It is mediated by the redox system: triaryl- or trialkylphosphine/dialkyl azodicarboxylate and brings about the nucleophilic substitution of an alcoholic hydroxyl group by the conjugate base of an acidic reactant, with inversion of configuration at the alcohol carbon. The Mitsunobu reaction is widely used in organic chemistry and its mechanism (scheme 1) has been intensively studied (for review - see [2-5]). This article deals with the application of the reaction in chemistry of amino acids.\nThe reaction was proposed as an effective method of a-amino acid synthesis using hydroxy acids as substrates. As the amino group synthons phtalimide [10, 11], (Scheme 2), hydrazoic acid [14], (Scheme 5) or t-butyl-2(trimethylsilil)ethylsulphonylcarbamate [18], (Scheme 7) were used. The procedure using HN3 was profoundly improved by the introduction of a&nbsp;stable bis-pyridine complex of zinc oxide [16]. The use of phtalimide as an amino group precursor in Mitsunobu-type reaction was succesfully applied to the synthesis of 2-2H-labelled chiral glycine [13], (Scheme 4). In the model studies on the synthesis of 15N-labelled N-protected chiral amino acids Degerbeck et al. [17] found that the yield of the Mitsunobu conversion (Scheme 6) depends on the acidity of the NH function in the imidocarbonate or sulphonylcarbamate used.\nThe Mitsunobu reaction has also been applied to the synthesis of many unnatural or modified amino acids such as protected 2,3-diamino butyric acid [19], 3- or 4-mercaptoproline derivatives [20, 21], (Scheme 8), N5-acetyl-N5-hydroxy-L-ornitine [22], (Scheme 9) and a-N-hydroxyamino acids [23], (Scheme 10). Wojciechowska et al. [24] have reported the preparation of dehydroamino acids from protected serine and threonine derivatives under the intramolecular Mitsunobu dehydration condition (Scheme 11).\nA general approach to the preparation of N-monoalkylated amino acids based on the Mitsunobu reaction has been developed [30] using N-tosylamino acid asters as acidic components of the reaction (Scheme 15). Since the removal of tosyl group is difficult, a&nbsp;modification of the N-alkylation procedure has recently been devised [32, 33].\nThe Mitsunobu reaction is also an excellent procedure for transforming hydroxy acids or hydroxy amino acids into esters whose subsequent hydrolysis leads to a&nbsp;stereoisomer of the initial compound with the inverted configuration at the carbinol centre and was very often used in this way [37, 38], (Scheme 8 and 17).\nThe Mitsunobu reaction provides also an interesting method of esterification in which an alcohol, not a&nbsp;carboxylic component, is activated. It was used to the synthesis of diphenylmethyl esters of N-trityl amino acids [43], to the attachment of a&nbsp;first amino acid to the polymer support [44] or to active ester synthesis [45], (Scheme 18).\nThe applications of the Mitsunobu reaction include also the preparation of many cyclic derivatives of amino acids such as b-lactams [51], (Scheme 20), aziridines [49, 54], (Schemes 19, 21) or b-lactons [60]. The last cyclic derivatives are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of b-substituted alanines (Scheme 22). b-Lactonization proceeds easily in case of serine derivatives whereas in threonine derivatives b-elimination is the dominant reaction [61], (Scheme 23). The review deals also with the applications of the title reaction to the synthesis of peptide (polyamide) nucleic acids (PNA) [31, 39, 40, 68, 69, 70].",

            "abstract": "The chemistry of spiranes has been studied extensively from many points of view and has already been the subject of several papers. Generally the spiranes are not a&nbsp;new class of compound in the chemical sense, but they retain the chemical properties of their parent moieties. Much interest has been focused on the bonding character of the central spiro-atom. This review describes all aspects of spirane chemistry, that have been developed in the last few years: spiroconjugation, helical structure, conformational transmission, photochromism and biologically active spiranes.\nWhen two perpendicular p systems are joined by a&nbsp;common tetrahedral atom, it is postulated that electronic delocalization will produce important and characteristic effects in the electronic spectrum [10, 11] and in chemical reactivity [14, 15]. This special case of homoconjugation has been called spiroconjugation (Scheme 1, 2). The presence of hypochromism suggest that the dominant conformation of spiranes is helical (Scheme 4, 5), [20-23]. The effect of conformational transmission in the series of new spirane systems was studied with the aid of 1H-NMR spectra (Scheme 7, 8), [36-38].\nThe photochromic behaviour of spiropyrans is based on the reversibility between the colourless \"closed\" spiropyran form and the coloured \"open\" merocyanine dye via heterolytic cleavage of the spiro oxygen-carbon bond (Scheme 9), [47, 48]. The spiropyrans and related compounds (spirooxazines) continue to arise a&nbsp;strong interest in various fields such as: non-silver high resolution photography [45], optical devices and holographic systems [46].\nMany representatives of spiranes have a&nbsp;useful biological activity (Schemes 10,11), [49-55]. For example, 1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane is the major component of the sex pheromone of the olive fruit fly [56].\nThe purpose of this article is to show a&nbsp;\"phenomenon\" of the spiro-atom and to present the most representative examples of this approach.",

            "abstract": "Antibiotics constitute a&nbsp;group of chemical compounds which arouse extreme excitements in people, in some cases great expectations and in others fear, anxiety and dismay. Such a&nbsp;situation is due to the observed effects of their action within the sphere of human life. Dosages of these chemicals may be regarded as indispensable and advantageous during medical treatment or as hazardous when overadosed. Antibiotics and antimicrobiological compounds constitute often toxic residuals in food. Due to a&nbsp;wide use of antibiotics as prophylactic measures in the breeding of animals which are the raw material base for the manufacture of food products, and the use of these compounds as food additives to prolong food stability and its life, there is a&nbsp;search going on to find out methods for determination and analysis of speciation of their trace quantities.\nA valuable and large group of diagnostic methods with potential possibilities and significance in such analyses consists of immunometric methods [1-7]. Generally, these methods are based on selective reactions of complex formation between antibodies and antigens or haptenes which have developed a&nbsp;specific antibody in vertebrates organisms [1-4, 6]. The results of immunochemical reactions depend on many factors such as the type of sorbent, size of active surface, kind of marker, specificity of the formed bonds directly or indirectly affecting the kinetics and physic-chemistry of the serologic process (precipitation or agglutination) [2-7, 16-18]. The use of immunodiagnosis as a&nbsp;method of food analysis results in a&nbsp;considerable lowering of detection and determination thresholds of many substances [8-15].\nKnown immunological methods can be successfully used not only for the evaluation of antibodies [2-4, 13-18], hormones [19-23], autoantigens [24], but also for the determination of the nutritious components of food [25-28], proteins [29-43], vitamins [44, 45] as well as toxic bacterial, mycotic and mould residues [48-54], antibiotics [55-61], alkaloids [62, 63] and pesticides [64-70]. These methods can be utilized for analyses of final products as well as intermediates and raw materials, including the assessment of specified technological processes [71-79]. Their use make it possible to lower the detection and determination thresholds of the compound under analysis [80-84, 134-136].\nStored food products give rise to the formation of antibiotics under the influence of present or developing microflora [91-103]. The hitherto used methods for the determination of antibiotics include mainly various chromatographic procedures such as HPLC [101-110], GC [106, 111-115], P & TLC [116, 117], MS [118-123], or enzymatic methods. All these methods have been recognized as sensitive and satisfying the requirements of analysts [124-127]. However, their general utilization is relatively low due to expensive apparatus and equipment required. Therefore, in order to improve the sensitivity of determination and to reduce the costs of analyses, in the seventies, analysts started to use thin layer or column chromatography in combination with enzymatic or immunochemical reactions [128-133]. At present, penetrating research is going on in analytics to widely use proteins and not only enzymatic ones [1-7, 13, 16-18].\nThe properties of specific proteins can be used in analytics as agents which either directly or indirectly form selective complexes with the component of the compound under analysis. To provide good and effective monitoring of such reactions, one of the serologic reaction components is marked with isotopic tracer (115J, 3H, 57Co, 14C), fluorochromes (fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine B isothiocyanate), enzymes (per-oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase, urease) or colloidal gold [1-7, 134-136]. In addition, there is used an avidin-biotin system, with antibodies being marked with biotin and enzymes with avidin. Such an extension of biomolecule application increases the sensitivity of the antibody-antigen reaction by increasing the number of addition sites on biotinylated antibodies.\nAmong the immunometric methods, the highest effectiveness is shown by immunoenzymatic methods which may have a&nbsp;wide application due to the simplicity of their use. The effectiveness of such an analysis depends on the stage of sample preparation being dependent, in turn, on the immunometric method selected. Then, the processes of sample preparation for analysis are different accordingly. In most cases the sample preparation is based on extraction with organic solvents to remove homogenates of samples under analysis [61]. It is a&nbsp;significant point of any analysis to consider the procedures of speciation examination [137-140]. Thus, the choice of immunometric methods, as those with a&nbsp;high specificity, to that end seems to deserve recommendation.\nThe present paper reports the results of comparison of methods for the determination of antibiotics in food products of animal origin. The multidirectional comparison of properties, characteristics and values of various chromatographic methods: HPLC, GC, P&TLC and GC-MS with various immunimetric methods has clearly resulted in the benefit of immunoenzymatic methods. The best results in terms of technical development are obtained by the immunoenzymatic method ELISA [2-4, 7, 15-17, 71-74, 83, 84, 138-140]. This is due not only to its high specificity, detectability, sensitivity, but also to the short time of analysis, possibility of multiple repetitions under the same testing conditions, simple equipment and personnel requirements as well as low costs of determination.",

            "abstract": "The theretical model proposed by Sav\u00e9ant [10] for the kinetics of the cleavage of aromatic anion radicals containing potential leaving groups and of their formation from aryl radicals and nucleophiles (essential steps of the SRN1 mechanism, shown in the Scheme 1) is presented. In that model the bond cleavage in anion radicals is viewed as an intramolecular dissociative one-electron transfer and the reverse reaction as an associative single-electron transfer. It leads to the quadratic relationship of the activation barrier DG\u00b9 and the reaction driving force DG\u00b0 (eq. (9)), similar to the classic equation of the Marcus theory for the outer-sphere electron transfer.\nExperimental consequences of the Sav\u00e9ant model are also reviewed. They include the relationship between the cleavage rate constants k4 and the formal potentials of the radical anion formation E\u00b0RX/RX\u00b7 - for the series of aryl chlorides and bromides in DMF (Fig. 3), solvent effects on the k4 values (Chapter 4), and the affect of substituents (Chapter 5). In particular, it was shown that the solvent effect on the thermodynamic contribution to the activation free-energy causes the increse of the cleavage rate constant for chloroanthracene radical anions with the solvent acceptor number (Fig. 4). However, for the dissociation of the C-Cl bond in radical anions of 4-chlorobenzophenone the solvent efect on the intrinsic activation barrier DG\u00b9o, given by eqs (13) and (14) , is dominant and the intrinsic rate constant depends (Fig. 5) on the solvent Pekar factor (1/eop-1/es). The use of the Hammett equation to the cleavage rate constants is also discussed; it works in the case when the thermodynamic contribution to the activation barrier (eq. (12)) strongly depends on a&nbsp;substitutent (Fig. 6).\nAll the reviewed experimental data on the kinetics of the bond cleavage and the formation of radical anions can be rationalized on the basis of the Sav\u00e9ant model.",

            "abstract": "The principle of ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) reported in 1930 by Lawrence et al. [9] was firstly applied in mass spectrometry by Hipple, Sommer and Thomas in 1949 [26]. Their instrument has never been commercialized due to several problems with electronics and vacuum. Next instrument constructed by Wobschall et al. in the 1960s [27] had more chance. It was modified by Llewellyn [28] in cooperation with Baldeschwieler et al. [29] and become a&nbsp;commercial Varian mass spectrometer in the late 1960s. Its drift cell contained three separeted regions: ion source, analyser and ion collector. Important modofication in ICRMS was proposed by McIver in 1970 [10a, b]. He introduced a&nbsp;one region trapped-ion analyzer cell and a&nbsp;pulsed mode of operation.\nFirst FT-ICR experiments were carried out by Comisarow and Marshall in 1974 [11]. They also applied a&nbsp;one region trapped-ion analyzer cell. The pulsed mode of operation in the one region cell was combined with Fourier transform techniques in first commercial Nicolet FT-ICR mass spectrometer. From this moment the FT-ICR mass spectrometry has become more attractive and more frequently used by chemists.\nSince ions may be trapped for extended periods prior to detection in an ICR cell, both, ICR and FT-ICR mass spectrometry have been used to the study of gas-phase ion-molecule reactions [1-6]. First experimental gas-phase data of sufficient precision obtained by ICRMS became available from the 1970s for the proton-transfer reactions [2, 7, 8, 10, 41-43].\nRelative acidity (DGA) or basicity (DGB) determinations were based on measurements of the equilibrium constants of proton exchange between two anions (A1- and A2-) or two bases (B1 and B2) [7, 8, 13a]. These reactions have been studied in order to determine intrinsic gas-phase acidities or basicities of compounds and to establish general gas-phase acidity/basicity scale. Presently there are a&nbsp;few thousands gas-phase data compiled in this scale by Lias et al. [40]. The upper limit of the GB scale is separated from the lower limit of the GA scale by ca 150 kJ/mol (Fig. 6), and thus spontaneous neutralization reactions between neutral acids and bases can not yet be observed in the gas phase.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism and kinetics of decay of excited Xe(6s[3/2]1,2) atoms formed by irradiation of pure Xe by xenon resonance light (l=147 nm) is presented basing on Moutard et al. [9] reaction scheme (r. (2)-(8)). The mechanism of the decay of higher xenon exited states (6p, 6d, ...) produced by the electron beam is also presented (r. (9)-(14)). On this basis the mechanism and kinetics of energy transfer processes to RCl molecules in Xe-RCl system leading to XeCl(B,C) excimers is discussed. In particular the mechanism and kinetics of two- and three-body reactions of the lowest Xe(6s[3/2]1) state with chlorine donor molecules is presented. It has been shown that the two-body energy transfer reactions (19) occur with the rate constants in the range (3.5-7)\u00b710-10cm3 s-1 [10, 11, 32, 33] (Tabs 1, 2). The yield of XeCl* excimers in these reactions is in the range from 0.02 for HCl up to 1.0 for Cl2 molecule (Tabs 1, 2). It has been shown also that at higher xenon pressures (above 20-50 Torr) with reaction (19) competes the fast three-body reaction (23), which also is a&nbsp;source of XeCl* excimers [10, 11]. The rate constants of reaction (23) for a&nbsp;few molecules are shown in Tab. 2. They are in the range (1-2) \u00b710-28cm6 s-1 and the yields of XeCl* excimers produced in these reactions are from 0.19 for CCl4 up to 0.5 for PCl3. It seems to be important in the construction of excimer lasers that in the case of HCl molecule, often used as a&nbsp;source of XeCl* excimers, the rate constant of three-body energy transfer reaction (23) is extremely high, k23=2.2 \u00b710-27cm6 s-1 [10] and the yield of XeCl* excimers in this process is equal to zero [10]. The XeCl* excimers decay via fluorescence with the maximum at l=308 nm, for B-X transition and l=340 nm for C-A transition. The typical spectrum of XeCl* excimers fluorescence is shown in Fig. 5. The fluorescence lifetime (r. (31), (32)) of XeCl* is equal to 11 and 120-130 ns, for B-X and C-A transitions, respectively [45, 58]. There is shown that the above values of XeCl* excimers lifetimes concern excimers at the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and they increase with v number (see Fig. 7) [43]. The mechanism and kinetics of collisional decay of highly vibrational XeCl(B,C) excimers with buffer gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr) is also presented (r. (27)-(30)) [43]. The relaxed XeCl(B,C) excimers decay also in the two- and three-body quenching with Xe and RCl molecules. The mechanism and kinetics of above processes is shown (see reactions (35)-(37) and Tab. 4).",

            "abstract": "Utracil thio-derivatives have become to play increasingly important roles in biology and medicine. Numerous sulphur-substituted pyrimidines have found applications as clinically useful drugs. Thiouracils have recently been the subject of considerable interest as they inhibit hyperthyroidism in man [1, 2], have been isolated from E. coli tRNA [3], and ihibit virus [4] and bacterial growth [5] by causing alterations [7] in protein synthesis. Thiouracils are also of interest because of mutagenic [7], anticancer and antithyroid activity [8], kidney stone formation inhibition [9] and antidote properties for mercury poisoning. Two of them, 2-thiouracil and 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, exhibit marked affinities for melanin-producing tissue in vitro and a&nbsp;similar affinity in vivo, where they presumably act as false precursors for melanin [10, 11]. Boron-containing derivatives of thiouracils [12-14] containing a&nbsp;dihydroxyboryl (or 1-o-carboranylalkyl) group in the 5-position are very important because of their potential applications for BNCT. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is one of the world's most serious health problems.

The studies of the structure-activity relationships of HEPT analogs indicated that replecement of the 2-oxo function with a&nbsp;thione function potentiated their ati-HIV-1 activity [16, 19, 20].\nTherefore the synthesis of thio-substituted pyrimidine bases and their derivatives appears to be a&nbsp;challenge for organic chemists.

            "abstract": "A quarter of a&nbsp;century has already passed since the most distinguished Polish pioneer in both natural products chemistry and stereochemistry, the scientist meritorious for chemistry education, Professor Jerzy Suszko, passed away. He was born in Silesia near Teschen in 1889 and studied at the Polytechnic of Prague where he finished his Ph.D. thesis under the auspices of Paul Rabe at the age of 24. After World War i&nbsp;he took on research work at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow collaborating with Karol Dziewo\u0144ski at the beginning. Next, after passing a&nbsp;habilitation examination and spending three years at the University of Lvov, he moved to Pozna\u0144, where he spent the second half of his life, working as a&nbsp;professor and the Head of the Organic Chemistry Department of the University of Pozna\u0144. Furthermore, he was to become the Head of the Laboratory of Alkaloids of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He also held some highly responsible offices at the University, the most important being a&nbsp;Rector of the University and a&nbsp;Dean of the Mathematical and Natural Science Faculty for a&nbsp;few years.\nThe main scientific achievements of Professor Jerzy Suszko were concerned with the chemistry of physiologically active natural products and with the spatial structure of organic molecules. From among the natural products, the alkaloids and especially those of cinchona bark were the most intensively studied mainly because of their pharmacological properties. His synthetic and structural studies analysed all the most reactive and stereochemically important fragments of the molecules of quinine and related alkaloids. This resulted in an elaboration of syntheses allowing interconversions both between the analogues differing by the kind of substituent in the quinoline moiety as well as the corresponding stereoisomers. Further significant achievements in the same field comprised, among others, the elaboration of a&nbsp;convenient method of a&nbsp;reverse conversion of quinotoxine (the product of an acid treatment of quinine but also occurring as the key intermediate in the quinine synthesis) and related toxins to the natural cinchona alkaloids, the determination of the pattern of rearrangement within the vicinal amino-alcohol fragment, and the discoveries in the chemistry of derivatives with a&nbsp;modified vinyl side chain, especially those being intramolecular ethers. The structure and conversion studies of other alkaloids concerned those occurring in the genera Papaver (codeine and rheadine), Lupinus and Cortinarius. At the beginning of the thirties, J. Suszko proposed a&nbsp;new method of determining the molecular symmetry, especially in the case of fused-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This method was next verified mainly on naphthalene molecules and was based on the binding of two identical chiral substituents to the ring system in different positions followed by an analysis of the resulting stereochemical mixture. Other stereochemical studies concerning stereocontrolled syntheses, conformation stability and configuration determination were carried out on various cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons, including bornane derivatives.\nProfessor Jerzy Suszko educated a&nbsp;great number of graduated students both in chemistry and pharmacy. From about forty people who got their Ph.D. degrees under his scientific supervision many later reached the highest levels in their scientific careers. He was a&nbsp;founding member of the Polish Chemical Society and was very much engaged in its activities during his whole life. He served in some responsible offices therein, including the President of the Society. He was also a&nbsp;member of several foreign scientific societies, including the American Chemical Society.",

This event was followed by different processes schematically divided into \"Planck\", \"hadron\", \"lepton\", \"radiation\" and \"galaxy\" era (table 1).\nUniversal abundance of elements is presented as a&nbsp;relation between logarithm of the elements (or isobars) abundance in the solar system and the atomic (or mass) numbers (fig. 1 and 2). These relations are treated as a&nbsp;records of the Universe evolution. Four groups of the nucleosynthesis are presented according to this idea (table 2): (1) primary reactions at the beginning of the Universe; (2) \"burning\" of light elements inside stars; (3) neutron capture inside stars; (4) photonuclear reactions inside strongly heated-up stars, natural disintegration of heavy elements inside and outside the stars, breaking of heavy elements in the interstellar space.\nLight chemical elements - from hydrogen to lithium - were created during the first minutes after the Big Bang by primary nucleosynthesis processes (reactions 1 - 7). This mechanism is responsible for very high abundance of hydrogen (~ 90% of all atoms in the Universe) and helium (~ 9%). Heavy elements are produced up to now inside stars.\nSpecial attention is paid to description of different stages and ways of star evolution (fig. 3) and to relations of this processes to the nucleosynthesis inside stars (reactions 8 - 38). These processes strongly depend on the beginning mass of the star. Stars similar to the sun are responsible for formation of carbon and oxygen only. In the bigger ones the elements up to the iron group can be formed. In the case of the largest ones supernova phenomenon is possible: the star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel, collapse into a&nbsp;superdense state, and explode with a&nbsp;final burst of enormous energy. This is responsible for reactions from the group (4).",

The subject of discussion in this paper is cisplatin which about thirty years ago has awaked a&nbsp;hope for an effective treatment of cancer. The following problems have been reviewed: the effect of various substituents on the biological activity of the compounds: cis-PtAm2X2 (where Am is ammine or amine and X is an anionic group), the mechanism of action of cisplatin and the structures of its coordination compounds with DNA. The side effects of cisplatin therapy, in particular its nefrotoxicity, and the attempts to establish the structure-activity relationship have also been discussed. The second and third generation of platinum-based drugs are presented, including the cisplatin drugs which are joint with some biologically active compounds. They act as the vectors delivering the drug directly to the cancerous cells, hereby decreasing toxicity of these drugs.",

            "abstract": "Any organic substances emitted from various sources into the oxygen-containing atmosphere are subjected to oxidation in sunlight-initiated reactions. The role of various processes in the sinks is different and inconstant because it depends not only on the physico-chemical properties of specific compounds but also on varying environmental conditions, solar radiation level, the content of anthropogenic pollutants and dust in the atmosphere, aerosol particles composition, etc. [1-3].\nA fundamental property of the Earth's atmosphere is its heterogeneity. Billions of tons of continuosly renewed finely dispersed material with tremendous surface and excess free energy are annually emitted into it. Aerosol particles formed during weathering of the Earth's crust mainly consist of minerals based on silica (pyroxene, epidote, mica, quartz, etc.) as well as apatite, magnetite, ilmenite, etc. [13-15]. The particles of NaCl and KCl in the sea aerosol contain as inclusion in the crystalline lattice the atoms of many metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ti, Zn, etc.) [9]. This composition of the main components of natural aerosol ensures the appearance of impurity conductivity upon irradiation with light in the near UV or even in the visible spectral regions (Tabl. 3).\nAs a&nbsp;result of irradiation, various active centers (free radicals and ions) are formed on the particles, thus ensuring the possibility of photochemosorption of volatile components [16-21]. Therefore, there is no doubt that the surface of solid particles of atmospheric aerosol should serve as an arena on which various chemical transformations with the participation of sorbed components take place (Tab. 5).\nThe results of laboratory investigations of the oxidation of isoprene, monoterpenes [43-45, 47], aromatic hydrocarbons [36, 44-46, 48, 50-52] and halocarbons [27, 28, 30] on particles of metal oxides, desert sand, volcanic ash, sea salt, and calcium carbonate are reported. The only gaseous oxidation product was CO2, however, a&nbsp;broad spectrum of intermediates is detected on the particle surface. The values of rate constants for heterogeneous oxidation of different organic compounds indicate that these reactions can compete with gas-phase oxidation and, hence, deserve attention as a&nbsp;possible sink of Corg in the atmosphere [48, 58-60].",

            "abstract": "Nonionic surfactants containing a&nbsp;polyoxyethylene chain 1 and 2 dissolve well in aqueous solutions due to the hydration of the hydrophilic chains. All parameters, e.g. temperature and electrolyte content, which affect the hydration change the solubility of nonionic surfactants in water. As a&nbsp;result, clouding of surfactant solutions is observed after heating them. The process is reversible and nonionic surfactants dissolve after cooling. Aqueous solutions of zwitterionic surfactants (3 and 4) also exhibit the cloud point phenomenon but in this case after cooling.\nThe cloud point temperature depends on several parameters, including the hydrophobicity and polydispersity of surfactants, the presence of additional organic compounds, e.g. alcohols, fatty acids, etc., and type and content of electrolytes. Therefore, the cloud point can be easily modified to cause the clouding at a&nbsp;temperature suitable for a&nbsp;separation process. The phases can be then separated, e.g. by centrifugation. However, only the knowledge of the surfactant-water phase diagrams (Figs. 1 and 2) permits the design of optimal conditions at which the surfactant-rich-phase is in equilibrium with almost pure water. Aqueous solutions of some b-cyclodextrine derivatives (Fig. 3) also exhibit the clouding phenomenon caused, however, by crystallisation.\nNonionic surfactants dissolved in organic solvents complex small amounts of ion pairs. As a&nbsp;result, they are considered as open analogs of crown ethers. Aqueous solutions containing surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration adsorb various organic and inorganic substances, including chelating agents and chelates. Ions can be also adsorbed by charged micelles. The spherical micelles of nonionic surfactants (Fig. 4) can be thus considered as dynamic analogs of crown ethers.\nTypical hydrophobic extractants/chelating agents used in hydrometallurgical processes are exceedingly large and scarcely soluble in aqueous solutions, including micellar solutions, to obtain high enough extractant concentrations. Because of that, hydrophilic complexing agents such as oxine, PAP, PAMP, etc. are used. Special reagents exhibiting both amphiphilic and chelating properties (5 and 6) can be also used. In this case they act simultaneously as surfactants and chelating agents.\nThe distributions coefficients of chelating agents (Tables 1 and 2) and their metal complexes (Table 3) between the surfactant-rich phase and the aqueous phase are comparable to those observed in classical extraction systems. These are, however, lower in comparison to those obtained for hydrophobic industrial extractants.\nThe recovery of metal ions from diluted aqueous solutions can be near 100% (Table 4). The system is also useful to recover various organic substances from aqueous solutions (Table 5) and from contaminated soil (Table 6). The technique has found already application for sample preconcentration, recovery of toxic substances from solutions and soils and for separation of expensive biological materials.",

It was Paster who in 1857 discovered that the chemistry of life had a&nbsp;preferred handedness. \"Life is manifested to us as a&nbsp;function of the dyssymetry of the universe\" he wrote. Pasteris work was carried out well before the recognition of the quadrivalence of the carbon by Kekule and Couper (1858). He did far more that simply discover the underlying theory of molecular asymmetry, he foresaw most of the consequences of that theory, he understood the principle of a&nbsp;transference of the asymmetric property from one set of molecules to another. Finally he clearly understood the biological implications of the discovery of asymmetry. The theory of organic stereochemistry has been established independently by van't Hoff and Le Bel in 1874.\nNow, very frequently we have the question why is no \"mirror life\". Would not biochemistry like ours with every configuration inverted be just as good? Was our way better or lucky? In 1957 it was found that mirror symmetry is broken on the subatomic level. Some elementary particles, like neutrino, exist only as a&nbsp;left-handed object. Thus, in fact, there are no exact enantiomers in our world. They are rather diastereoisomers of different energy. Thus, our mirror images friends living on the other side of the looking glass, with all the biological molecules with opposite configurations would not be as perfect as we are.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of physicochemical and toxicological properties of organic compounds with selected topological indices have been reviewed in monographs [1-14] and in dedicated articles [15-40]. The first topological indices used to prediction of selected physicochemical properties (the boiling point, heat of formation, heat of vaporozation, molar volume, molar refraction) were Wiener index, polarity number [41-45] and Platt's index [46]. The Wiener index has been continuously modified [47-64].\nIn recent years topological indices have come prominently to the fore on several different fronts. The prime reason for the wide publicity accorded to these indices has been the remarkable ability to correlate and predict the properties of a&nbsp;vast range of molecular species. Topological indices based on the adjacency matrix, on the distance matrix and on information theory were applicable to the calculation of many physicochemical properties [2, 8, 13-15, 17-19, 21, 28, 30-33, 39, 41-46, 65-199] and to the evaluation of biological and of toxicological properties [1, 2, 8, 17, 19, 21-25, 27, 28, 33, 34, 36, 37, 70, 110, 105, 111, 116, 121, 122, 131, 144, 148, 152, 162, 165, 166, 168, 171, 176, 200-286] of organic compounds.\tThe procedure for calculating the topological indices is illustrated in this work by the calculation of the topological indices based on the adjacency matrix (the Gutman index (M1) [8, 9, 26, 287, 288], eq.(1); the Randi\u0107 connectivity indices (oc, 1c, 2c,ocn, 1cn, 2cv) [ 1, 2, 8, 9, 26, 288-290], eqs. (2),(3)); on the distance matrix (the Wiener index (W) [8, 9, 26, 41-45, 288, 291], eq.(4), Tab.1; the Pyka indices (A, oB, 1B, 2B) [288, 295, 296], eqs.(5)-(8); the Balaban index (IB) [9, 26, 288, 292-294], eq.(9); the Schultz Molecular Topological Index (MTI) [9, 88, 288], eq.(10)) for pentamethylenediamine. It should be remarked that none of these topological indices yet described differentiates between d and l isomers. The procedure for calculating the optical topological index (Iopt) for d and l isomers is illustrated in this work by the calculation of Iopt for d- and l- alanine [288, 298, 299], eq.(11), fig.1. Applications of these topological indices for the correlation analysis are discussed.\nThe TLC [2, 14, 15, 17, 98, 118, 134-138, 140, 144, 164, 165, 167, 183, 186, 267-270, 295-297, 303-321], the HPLC [15-17, 137-139, 150, 152, 162, 164, 165, 256, 300, 302, 309, 310, 315, 320, 323-356], and the GC [2, 15, 17, 25, 28, 66, 87, 98, 125, 165, 167, 187, 310, 312, 317, 320, 339, 357-424] retention parameters of different organic compounds were calculated using the equations with the topological indices. As examples, selected correlation equations for calculation retention parameters in TLC (eqs.(12)-(20)), in HPLC (eqs.(23)-(31)), and in GC (eqs.(32)-(43), and eqs.(45)-(48)) were shown in this work.\nDefinitions of the three-dimensional Wiener number - 3W [9, 47, 67, 425-427], eq.

            "abstract": "Without doubt, water is the most studied system in chemistry. Despite this fact, water is still far from being satisfactorily described on the molecular level and continues to fascinate new generations of chemists [1]. This situation reflects the difficulty of providing a&nbsp;structural description that accounts for the dynamic behavior of the H bonding ability of water, i. e., the ability of water molecules to form different structures. The aim of this work was to present different models describing: 1) a&nbsp;water molecule; 2) hydrogen-bond networks; 3) the water structure.\nA first model of a&nbsp;water molecule was done by Bjerrum [7]. Various modifications of this model were proposed later. Water models proposed by Ben-Naim-Stillinger (BNS model) [8] and Stillinger-Rahman (ST2 model) [9] are tipical ones among the four-point charge models. The model proposed by Rowlinson [10] is a&nbsp;modified four-point charge model. Matsuoka-Clementi-Yoshimine's model [11] is a&nbsp;three-point charge model of the water molecule. Jorgensen's model [3] is also described in this work. Besides these rigid models of a&nbsp;water molecule, flexible models have also been introduced. Typical ones are the central force (CF) model [13] and its modifications proposed by Bopp-Jancs\u00f3-Heinzinger (BJH) [14].\nWe also present different models describing hydrogen-bond networks: model based on polygons [33] (rys. 1), bond percolation models [34, 39] and lattice models (square water - rys. 2 - [37], simplified square water [38], brick water [38]).\nModels describing the water structure may be divided into two main classes: mixture (a fluid composed of molecular clusters of various sizes) and continuum models [40, 41]. Continuum models are not sufficient to explain the unusual behavior of H2O and D2O.\nWater can also appear to be a&nbsp;macroscopic, space-filling gel-like network [34, 35, 42, 43]. This structural picture of water combines ideas of continuum models with ideas of mixture models.",

Marcus [4] used this model to describe the hydration process and its conceptual stages.\nIn the model of \"fluctuating icebergs\" proposed by Frank and Evans [11], solutes were considered to order water molecules around themselves. Ordering of water, \"iceberg formation\" was believed to occur by the development of interconnected networks of hydrogen bounds. Solutes which imposed order, (promoted iceberg formation) were considered to be structure makers. Similarly, solutes which decreased order were said to be structure breakers.\nThe influence of ions on the water structure can be determined by means of: 1) comparison of the interaction energies among water molecules around the ion with those in pure water [13]; 2) the viscosity B-coefficients of the Dole-Jones equation, the average number of hydrogen bonds in which a&nbsp;water molecule participates ((GHB), a&nbsp;residual entropy (Sstr) and heat capacity of hydration (Cpstr) due to the change in the structure of the water [14]; 3) analyzing the laser-Raman spectra of water in the region of OH stretching [15].

            "abstract": "We present aromatic thioketones as an excellent set of compounds for investigations of kinetics of fast bimolecular reactions studied by fluorescence quenching. It would be interesting to study seven compounds with fluorescence lifetimes ranging from 64 ps for thioxanthione to 880 ps for 2,2,3,3-tetramethylindanthione in perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (see Table 2). Moreover, the kinetics of fluorescence decay of all the studied thioketones in perfluoroalkanes without a&nbsp;quencher is very well established with xanthione as one of the most thoroughly studied compounds (see Table 3). Previous theoretical work has suggested that investigations of the kinetics of quenching involving compounds with very short fluorescence lifetimes would be a&nbsp;promising avenue of approach to obtaining more definitive experimental information for modeling studies. The aromatic thioketones are such donors. For xanthione, with a&nbsp;lifetime of 178 ps, and 1,3,4,5,6,8-xanthione-d6, with a&nbsp;lifetime of 600 ps, the kinetics of quenching can be described satisfactorily by the SCK theory [42-45]. The parameters such as the sum of donor and quencher radii and the sum of their diffusion coefficients, obtained from this theory, are in rather good agreement with the corresponding values determined by other methods. Unfortunately, a&nbsp;rather large uncertainty in the determination of the proper rate constant k, prevents obtaining an unambiguous answer to the question of whether the large values of k are characteristic of the systems studied or instead are a&nbsp;consequence of the model employed [46,47]. Also the mechanism of quenching of the S2 states of the thioketones by hydrocarbons is not yet clear.",

            "abstract": "In this article we describe new developments in the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles by hetero-Diels-Alder reaction covering the literature since 1990. a&nbsp;main point of discussion is stereoselectivity of the reactions and the preparation of enantiopure compounds either by using dienes and dienophiles carrying a&nbsp;chiral auxiliary or by using Lewis acids.\nSix-member nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds can be obtained by cycloaddition of aza-1,3-butadienes with carbon dienophiles or by the cycloaddition of electron rich dienes with imines, iminium ions and nitriles acting as dienophiles. 1-Aza-1,3-butadienes may react as electron rich as well as electron deficient dienes in normal cycloaddition or in the cycloaddition with inverse electron demand. E.g. N,N-dimethyl hydrazone prepared from a, b-unsaturated aldehydes 1 react smoothly in normal cycloaddition with electron deficient dienophile [4], (Scheme 1). However N-acyl- and N-sulfony- imines of a, b-unsaturated aldehydes e.g. 10 react as electron deficient dienes in reaction with an inverse electron demand [8], (Scheme 4). Similarly to 1-aza-, 2-aza-1,3-butadienes may react as electron rich or as electron deficient component upon appropriate substitution.\nA versatile approach to functionalized pyrimidines involves the reaction of 1,3-diaza-1,3-butadienes 60 with ketenes [23] (Scheme18). Intramolecular cycloadditions of 1,3-diazadienes 71 efficiently yield complex polycyclic molecules [25] (Scheme 20). Theoretical and synthetical studies carried out by van der Plas et al. [29]. deal with intramolecular cycloaddition of 5(w-alkynyl)pyrimidines 77. The substrate initially formed a&nbsp;bridged adducts (Scheme 22), that upon heating release the fused pyridine derivatives and appropriate cyanides by retro Diels-Alder reaction.\nThe second approach to construction of six-membered nitrogen-heterocycles by Diels-Alder reaction consists in cycloaddition of electron rich dienes with imines or nitriles, that act as dienophiles. Electron deficient imines e.g. acyl- or sulfonyl- imines add to many 1,3-dienes in good yields affording tetrahydropyridines [36,41], (Schemes 27 and 32). The cycloadditions of nonactivated imines have been investigated with regard to the effects of electronically neutral substituents and the influence of Lewis acids. The recent work in this area deals with asymmetric induction in azadiene reaction. E.g. the utility of chiral imines derived from enantiopure amino acids 93 in cycloaddition with electron rich diene in presence of Lewis acid lead to pyridone 95 in very good diastereoselectivity (95% de) [36] (Scheme 27). Chiral Lewis acids were also used in order to carry out enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions starting from achiral substrates and chiral catalyst. E.g. the reaction of imine derived from 3-pyridineformaldehyde 106 and Danishefsky's diene 89 afforded the desired cycloadduct 107 in high optical purity [40], (Scheme 31). Cyanides have been found to be less reactive than imines since the reactions require of extremely high temperatures. However sulfonyl nitriles 112 react with a&nbsp;variety of dienes under much milder conditions affording pyridine derivatives 114 [42].",

            "abstract": "Taxol (1), a&nbsp;highly functionalised complex diterpenoid orginally derived from the bark of Pacific yew, has received in recent decade wide attention of scientists in all fields of life sciences and chemistry, after the discovery of its strong and unique anticancer properties. Fast and spectacular career of this molecule (Table 1) is a&nbsp;subject of the present review. The large scale of research on Taxol is the consequence of public and commercial response to successfull treatment of various cancer diseases and impossibility of solving basic technological and intellectual problems such as: production, drug formulation, structure-activity relationship elucidation. The discussion in divided in separate sections:\n1. Activity and pharmacological phenomena of Taxol.\n2. Production of Taxol by biotechnological and chemical methods, including synthesis of Taxol side chain.\n3. Structure-Activity relationship (SAR) of Taxoids.\nAfter Horwitz reported in 1979 a&nbsp;strongly antimitotic activity of Taxol [3], interest in developing the pharmacology and biochemistry of this class of natural products increased.\nTaxol molecule promotes anticancer activity by enhancing polymerization of tubulin and stabilization of microtubules [6]. This process has the effect of inhibiting the normal dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton (which consist of microtubules) that is necessary for interphase and cell division in mitosis [4].\nTaxol and Taxotere are successfully used for the treatment of a&nbsp;variety of cancers, in particular ovarian and breast cancer [10], [11].\nThe biggest problem hindering wider application of this drug is its limited availability from natural sources. One kg of Taxus brevifolia bark yields only 100-170 mg of Taxol, after long and complicated extraction procedure. Since the yew is slow growing species this methode of obtaining the drug is controvertible and unprofitable (see scheme 2). An alternative source of Taxol is semisynthesis (see scheme 3) [48], where natural precursor of Taxol 10-deacetylbaccatin (10-DAB) can be extracted from regenerable twings of popular yew Taxus baccata [32] and after coupling with synthetically prepared side chain (see table 2 and refrences cited therein) can be converted to Taxol or Taxotere.\nTaxol has also been prepared by a&nbsp;number of total syntheses [66-70] but none of these is expected to enter the phase of commercial production. Biotechnological approaches to production by tissue culture [27-31] or fungi cultivation [24] have been reported.\nStudies in the area of Taxoids structure-activity relationships have first demonstrated two basic principles. The so-called 'southern' substituents, such as C-2 benzoate and the side chain, are crucial for the activity. 'Northern' substituents at C-7, C-9 and C-10 can be changed without drastic effect on the activity. The role of the substituents at C-1, the oxetane ring and diterpenoid core modifications are less well understood.\nThere are many reports of significant activity of highly transformed taxoids, including those with: modified ABC core (scheme 15 [92-93]), open C-ring structure (picture 2 [96]) and aromatic C-ring (picture 2 [94]).\nThese results indicate the possibility of obtaining a&nbsp;synthetic, structurally simplified variant of Taxol.",

            "abstract": "Although most of the drugs have been discovered serendipitously [3] the rational design of the molecules has been attempted for years. However, only the recent years brought a&nbsp;variety of new techniques providing unquestionably efficient procedures. In particular, the methodology of 2D and 3D quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) and combinatorial chemistry should be mentioned.\nIn this review the basic methodology of the classical Hansch QSAR approach has been briefly discussed [23-52]. In general, classical two-dimensional QSAR fails to distinguish between stereoisomers. This fact inspired the development of the idea of 3D QSAR [53-59]. Just the last year brought the concept that coined the term 4D QSAR covering quantitative description of conformational effects [68].\nOn the other hand, the comparative molecular field analysis CoMFA [55] (outlined in Fig. 2), which is the most common 3D QSAR scheme, demands perfect alignment of the series of molecules analyzed. Moreover, the results critically depend upon the way of overlaying the molecules. The CoMFA and 4D QSAR analyses base on the statistical techniques of the partial least square (PLS) and cross-validation procedure - Fig. 1 [41-43].\nBoth from the theoretical and practical points of view more flexible procedures for the alignment of molecules are needed [52, 53]. a&nbsp;comparative technique of self-organizing neural network provides one of alternatives allowing for such more flexible visualization and quantitative analysis of molecular similarity - Figs. 3, 4 [60-65]. The problem of the molecules' alignment can also be solved by the use of the a&nbsp;new 2D QSAR technique, the so-called holographic QSAR (HQSAR) which uses fragmental coding of the molecule - Fig. 5 [70-72].\nCombinatorial chemistry is a&nbsp;method that puts together the randomness of screening and the rationality of design [73-84]. The idea of combinatorial synthesis (Fig. 6) consists in the parallel synthesis of the set (combinatorial library) of compounds obtained simultaneously. Depending upon the technique used such libraries can be obtained as complex mixtures of the products of the defined composition or separate compounds. Although it is the diversity of molecular library created by combinatorial procedure that allows for increasing the probability of finding active analogs, combinatorial methods are far from brute randomness [78, 80]. The new methods for the description of the similarity of such libraries have been proposed [79-81]. The newest trend represented by in-vitro nucleic acid selection which is designed to mimic the Nature's evolutionary processes is probably one of the most interesting idea in drug design [82-83]. Just recently this idea has been expanded to the small organic molecules [84].",

            "abstract": "Stereochemistry, often regarded merely as a&nbsp;descriptive discipline, is an inexhaustible source of mathematical problems. Group theory, topology, graph theory, etc. are widely applied to the description of molecular architecture and conformational dynamics, to isomer counting and labelling, interpretation of spectra and more. Both mathematics and stereochemistry benefit from their marriage: new theorems are proved and new molecules synthesised.\nThis review is concerned with molecular symmetry, an idea which, appropriately generalised, is central to stereochemistry. Depending on what we imagine a&nbsp;molecule to be, whether a&nbsp;rigid body, a&nbsp;set of nuclei, or a&nbsp;graph, the nature of symmetry operations changes. Our attempt is to demonstrate how various symmetry models work, explore their capabilities, and show how they are interrelated by virtue of their common group theoretical framework.\nPoint groups, derived in the opening section, are by far the most popular symmetry descriptors albeit applicable only to instantaneous configurations of molecules. Point groups, providing little information on the actual structure of a&nbsp;molecule, can be extended into so called framework groups [11] which detail the distribution of atoms over sites of different local symmetry. From the structure of minimal framework groups the frequency of various point symmetries amongst molecules can be inferred. This is illustrated with a&nbsp;number of examples.\nThe following section introduces the idea of permutational symmetry and its application to non-rigid molecules. The permutation-inversion (PI) group of Longuet-Higgins [38] is defined and exemplified, its semidirect product structure being discussed in some depth. The PI group is then used for the description of selected dynamic processes, such as the rearrangements of bullvalene or 'racemization' of Mislow's ester [51]. Finally, the classification of nuclei used in NMR spectroscopy is expressed in terms of equivalence classes within the PI group.\nThe final section deals with topological properties of molecules. The principles of graph theoretical approach to molecular symmetry are outlined. Topological stereoisomerism is then defined, and the synthetic philosophy of topological stereochemistry and its achievements are briefly reviewed. We end with a&nbsp;discussion of symmetry properties of topologically non-trivial species, paying particular attention to realizability of automorphisms and chirality of graphs.",

Microwave ovens provide a&nbsp;clean and cheap alternative to conventional oil baths. The popularity of microwave heating for organic synthesis has increased to the extent that it now forms the basis of a&nbsp;number of commercial systems, and has even made its way into undergraduate laboratory courses.\nMicrowave heating has been proven to be of benefit particularly for the reactions under \"dry\" media (i.e., in the absence of a&nbsp;solvent, on solid support with or without catalysts) and offers a&nbsp;number of advantages: solvents are often expensive, toxic, difficult to remove in the case of aprotonic solvents with high boiling point. Liquid-liquid extraction can be avoided for the isolation of reaction products. Moreover, the absence of solvent reduces the risk of explosions when reaction takes place in a&nbsp;microwave oven.\nIn the present article micrawave-assisted organic syntheses are reviewed in the context of their most significant examples.",

This method describes the formation of enol ethers in excellent yield. However the scope of application is limited because of the loss the alkoxy group.\nThe reduction of phenyl ketones usually leads to corresponding alcohols and next to hydrocarbons but, in certain cases, it gives products of the benzene ring reduction with partially reduced carbonyl group. Products depend on the position other groups on the benzene ring and their type.\nIn the case of the reduction of 2H-chromenes, chroman-2-ones and chroman-4-ones the major products are phenols, if the reaction is carried out without an additional source of protons (ethyl or methyl alcohol).",

It has been demonstrated that many of these reconstruction phenomena can also be observed for the metal surface in contact with an electrolyte [6,17]. The data presented will focus on the surface reconstruction of Au(100) electrode in view of the results of recent electrochemical studies. We shall describe the preparation and the conditions under which Au(100)-(hex) surface is stable in solution. Flame annealed Au(100) surface is reconstructed and it is demonstrated under what condition this initial (thermally induced) reconstruction is preserved during and after the contact with electrolyte [18,19].\nThe so-called charge-induced reconstruction [27] and its influence on electrochemical adsorption reactions [30] is presented. The kinetics studies of surface structural transition due to charge-induced reconstruction or anion-induced lifting of the reconstruction are discussed in some detail. Finally, the role of the surface charge and the coverage of the adsorbate in the lifting of the reconstruction of Au(100) surface is briefly discussed [39,40 ].",

            "abstract": "In the first part of this review preparative methods and structural studies of s-bonded dihydrogen complexes of the transition group matels have been discribed. The former includes the most common procedures of direct reaction of coordinatively unsaturated complexes with hydrogen gas and protonation of metal hydride species. The M\u00be(h2 - H2 ) bonding in these complexes is best described as a&nbsp;s(HH) electron density donation to an empty metal d orbital of s symmetry s(HH)\u00aed s (M) augmented by a&nbsp;synergistic back-donation from filled metal d obitals (dp(M) \u00ae(s*(HH)) (Fig. 1).\nFrom among methods of detemining solid state structures, the most accurate are the neutron diffraction studies that have been successfully applied to 11 complexes (Table 1). Progress in broader application of this method is slow due to the need for preparation of large crystals and the shortage in the world of neutron scatering and diffraction facilities.\nIn solution, the most reliable data are acquired by NMR methods. Large J(HH) coupling constant values of 12 to 34 Hz [68b] and short minimal spin-lattice relaxation time values of ~ 3 ms T1min \u00be (h2 - H2 ) bonds. The dependence of T1min on speed of rotation ensures that T1min values measured for fast spinning H2 ligands are 4 times longer than those observed for slow rotational motion regimes and that the H\u00beH distance for these two types of motion is linked by the relation: dfast(HH) = 0.793 \u00b7 dslow(HH) [60]. Taking into account the generally accepted view that dihydrogen complexes may be regarded as intermediates along the pathway to H2 oxidative addition, Morris [18] and Maseras [43] proposed the following classification of hydragen atoms in these complexes: 0.8 - 1.1 \u00c5 (dihydrogen complexes), 1.1 - 1.3 \u00c5 (\"stretched' dihydrogen complexes), 1.3 - 1.4 \u00c5 (compressed dihydrides), > 1,6 \u00c5 (classical dihydrides).",

            "abstract": "The second part of the paper presents the reactivity of dihydrogen complexes beginning with the ability of the coordinated H2 ligand to undergo heterolytic splitting (i.e. their acidic properties). Generally, the low energy of the M\u00be(h2 - H2 ) bond in dihydrogen complexes results in a&nbsp;facile loss of the H2 ligand and is usually accompanied by substitution, substitution followed by an intramolecular reaction, ligand exchange, or elimination followed by dimerization.\nDihydrogen complexes (most often Ir, Os, Ru) show catalytic activities in isotope H/D exchange reactions in the homogeneous hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes (Table 4), arenes, ketones, in alkene silylation as well as in hydrogen transfer reactions between solvent (usually an alkohol) and an unsaturated substrate [69]. In the presence of a&nbsp;dihydrogen acceptor (e.g. t-Bu-CH=CH2) dihydrogen complexes are involved in the stoichiometric dehydrogenations of alkanes to alkenes. Only one example of a&nbsp;molecular hydrogen complexes reducing nitrogen or sulfur containing heteroaromatic rings has been reported [81].\nMolecular hydrogen complexes may undergo different reactions depending on their role in the catalytic cycle. Under hydrogenation conditions dihydrogen ligand can be easily substituted by unsaturated organic molecules . In this way, H2 molecule stabilizes unsaturated catalysts without bothering the coordination of the substrate (e.g. IRH2(H2)(PMe2Ph)3]+ [70], Scheme 2).\nSome dihydrogen complexes are regarded as intermediates for the homolytic activation of dihydrogen (e.g. [M(CO)3(nbd)(H2)] M=CR, Mo [75] and [Rh(HCO)(CO)3(H2)] [89]). In other complexes the H2 molecule acts as a&nbsp;reagent capable of hydrogenating substrate via an intramolecular acid/base reaction (Scheme 4; [78]). Similarly, the heterolytic splitting of H2 ligand in [Ru(OEP)(thf) 2(H2)] by the strong base (KOCH) [9] or in [Ir(bq)H(H2)(PPH3)2]+ by an alkohol [36] promote the H/D isotopic exchange reaction.\nThe proposed mechanisms for the hydrogenation of alkenes (alkynes) catalysed by dihydrogen complexes are typical for the catalytic cycles of many other homogeneous hydrogenation processes. These include formation of a&nbsp;vacant coordination site (usually by loss of a&nbsp;H2 molecule, but also by dissociation of one of the \"arms\" of the phosphine ligand [78]) followed by coordination of a&nbsp;substrate, its insertion into a&nbsp;M\u00beH bond, hydrogenolysis of an alkyl (allyl) moiety followed by product elimination.\n",

Until now thousands of LH-RH analogs were synthesized and some of them were appllied in gynecology and oncology. Such achievements were possible through replacing proteinic L-amino acids in LH-RH molecule for nonproteinic synthetic D-amino acids [7-11]. The luliberin called also gonadoliberin (Gn-RH) plays an important role as regulator of reproduction. Secretion of lutropin (LH) by anteriol pituitary cells in an pulsative manner is controlled by pulsatile release of LH-RH from hypothalamus [8, 21, 22]. It was well established that the surge of LH at midcycle in woman urines is an authentic predictor of approaching ovulation [83, 109, 110]. In gonades LH stimulates synthesis of sex steroid hormones [83, 111-114]. The well known luliberin analogs were: Buserelin (Suprefact), Zoladex (Goserelin) and Cetrorelix (SB75). They were applied for treatment of prostatic, ovarian and breast cancers, endometriosis and in vitro fertilization [7, 11].",

            "abstract": "The development of semiconductor gas sensors for the detection of combustion and toxic gases has been in progress for several years. Ceramics gas sensors based on SnO2, TiO2, ZnO have been widely accepted as an important tool for detecting or monitoring gases and vapours like H2, CO , CH4 , H2S , C2H5OH [9-13]. The sensors are manufactured by means of different technologies. The most popular ones are resistant sensors based on SnO2, developed in Japan and currently produced on a&nbsp;large scale. Among these, TGS sensors ( Tagushi Gas Sensors) from Japanese company Figaro are the most popular ones [4]. The principle of the operation of this type of sensors consist in a&nbsp;comparison of electrical resistance of semiconducting oxide in air , and in the presence of the detected gas. The change in resistance is a&nbsp;function of the concentration of the gas. The gas sensing mechanism for a&nbsp;reducing gas such as carbon monoxide involves the reaction of CO with ionosorbed oxygen on the sensor surface leading to a&nbsp;decrease in resistance. The process can be summarised [28,37]\nThus, these sets of equations show the catalytic oxidation reaction where the catalyst is a&nbsp;surface of sensor . Catalytic effects play an important role in many areas of gas detection. The work of resistant sensors based on different semiconductors relies on catalytic reaction of the oxygen and detected gas at solid surface. This paper reviews the role of catalysis in the metal-oxide semiconductor device, which measures gas concentrations in terms of the changes in electrical conductivity induced by adsorption or reaction of gases on the solid surface. Although this review is limited to consideration of ceramic sensors , many of the aspects discussed will apply to thin- and thick-films sensors.\nBecause problem of catalysis in detection gases is very large, the review is divided into four parts : I. Sensing mechanism and preparation, II. The correlation between adsorption and detection, III. The correlation between catalytic activity and detection. In the last part of paper (part IV) i&nbsp;would like to show the role of adsorption and catalysis in other semiconductors gas sensors such as Pd-MISFET, SAW or Zirconia sensors.\nIn this part of the paper, the mechanisms of detection and the influence of oxide-metal semiconductor preparation on properties of ceramics gas sensors is presented. The results of different works show that the sensing characteristic of a&nbsp;semiconductor gas sensors can be improved by controlling fundamental factors which affects its receptor and transducer functions. The transducer function is related to the microstructure of the sintering specimen. This microstructure is characterised by the grain size (D) and the depth of surface space-charge layer (L) [45] . On the other hand, the receptor function is modified by the introduction of foreign receptors on the surface of sensors. In the particular cases of Pt, Pd and Ag are promotors. These problems are presented in aspects of phenomenon of adsorption and catalysis and the role, which they play in detection of gases.",

            "abstract": "The title dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (Fig. 1) belong to the class of the synthetic tetraaza macrocyclic ligands of bioinorganic relevance. Their similarity to porphyrins makes them attractive as models of important biological systems like for examle hemoproteins (hemoglobin, myoglobin), cytochromes and metalloenzymes (e.g. oxygenases, peroxidases, catalase) [2. 4].\nDibenzotetraaza[14]annulene and porphyrin ligand both have four coplanar nitrogen donor atoms and substantial bond unsaturation and delocalization in the macrocyclic framework. However, the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes are H\u00fcckel anti-aromatic (4n), whereas the porphyrins are fully delicakizes aromatic (4n+2). There is also remarkable difference in the conformation of the macrocyclic ligand which is flat in porphyrins and taa system (R1 = R3 = H) and sadlle-shaped in the case of other dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (R1 = R3 \u00b9 H). The conformation of the ligands greatly influences the metal coordination geometries in their metal complexes. Structure of the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes is discussed in details in Part II.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the readers with the preparative methods of the synthesis of various dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes. Reactivity of the macrocyclic framework is also reviewed, as a&nbsp;method of further modidication of the ligand structure.\nAll synthetic methods are divided into two distinct categories, know as non-template and metal-ion template procedures. In the first case, the 2+2 condensation of the substrates takes place leading in one step to dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ligand. The non-template approach is especially well suited for the synthesis of the H2taa ligands (R1 = R3 = H) and is exemplified by the reaction of n-phenylenediamine with propynal [8, 9], malondialdehyd [11, 12], acroleine and its derivatives [13-15], as well as with vinamidinium salts [16] (Scheme 2-8).\nIn the template procedures, similar condensation reactions are catalytically improved by metal ions, usually Ni2+ (in some instances also Co2+ or Cu2+), leading to corresponding metal complexes of the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (R1 = R3 \u00b9 H). Demetallation procedures have to be employed in this case, in order to isolate free ligands [7, 21, 25]. The most often cited template reactions are described in the papers [17-21] and outlined in Schemes 9-13.\nThe g,g' positions of the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ring appeared to be the reactive nucleophilic centres. The reactions with diazonium salts [36, 37], halogenation [38], alkylation [56], acylation by means of mono- and dicarboxylic acids chlorides [39-44, 47] give rise to corresponding mono- and disubstituted products. a&nbsp;wide range of 7,16-substituted derivatives of the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene complexes have been synthesized by the reaction with glutaryl chloride [25, 48] and further chemical transformations within the g,d-unsatureted lactonic substituents [49, 50]. Oxidation of the macrocyclic Ni(II) complexes leads to dimers [57], reaction with cyanogen allows to synthesize g,g'-cyano and cyanoimine derivatives. a&nbsp;new type of matallorganic dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene complexes was obtained as a&nbsp;result of the reaction of [Co(tmtaa)py)] + with acetylene, nitriles and norbernene [59-61]. Schemes 20-28 outline the reactivity of the dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ring.",

            "abstract": "\nSynthesis. As it was reported in Part I, the 2 + 2 condensation of o-phenylenediamine with b-dicarbonyl compounds, carried out in the presence of metal ions, leads easily and efficiently to the metal complexes. However, this so called template procedure is limited only to the later transition metals, usually Ni2+, more rarely Cu2+ and Co2+. Consequently, the majority of complexes of other metals, described in the literature, have been synthesized by the insertion of metal into the preformed macrocyclic ligand. The insertion is usually accomplished through the reaction of a&nbsp;free ligand with a&nbsp;salt of the appropriate metal (e.g. [1, 74, 97]) or its labile complex (e.g. [25, 36, 89]), as well as by the reaction with a&nbsp;metallorganic compound (e.g. [51, 109, 110]) (Scheme 1). The use of dilithiated derivatives of dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (Scheme2) instead of a&nbsp;neutral ligand proved to be also successful [66, 81].\nA number of new metal derivative have been obtained as a&nbsp;result of further reactions of the metal complexes with various reagents. For example, oxidation of a&nbsp;central metal atom [5, 89] and transmetallation [53], as well as metal-carbon [77, 17, 18] and metal-metal [29, 31, 52] bond formation are reported.\nStructure. X-Ray crystal structure determination has been done for a&nbsp;number of free ligands and metal complexes of dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes. Crystallographic data for the main important ligands and complexes may be found in the following papers: H2taa - [128, 132], H2tmtaa - [25], H2omtaa [121, 122], H2dmdptaa - [125], 6,17-dmtaa - [129], [Ni(II)taa] - [124], [Ni(II)tmtaa] - [131], [Cu(tmtaa)] - [130, 133], [Ni(dmtaa)] - ]123]. a&nbsp;review concerning the transition metal complexes has also appeared [126].\nIt has been found crystallographically that dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene ring in unsubstituted taa system is planar, both in the free ligand H2taa and its square Ni(II) complex [124]. On the other hand, 6,8,15,17-tetrasubstituted macrocycles adopt the saddle-shaped conformation in which o-phenylene rings and diimnate chelate framework are tilted to opposite sides of the plane defined by four nitrogen atoms (Fig. 1).\nNon-planar conformation of the macrocyclic framework in the H2tmtaa greatly influences the coordination geometry in their metal complexes. Saddle-shaped deformation together with a&nbsp;relatively small size of the coordination cavity results in the tendency of metal centres to be displaced out of the N4 plane. Consequently, 5-coordination (square pyramidal), found for example in [Fe(III)(tmtaa)Cl] [1], [Cr(III)(tmtaa)Cl] [50] and [Co(III)(tmtaa)] [1, 5], seems to be more favourable than 6-coordination. Moreover, in the 6-coordinated complexes metal ion favour cis cofiguration (trigonal prismatic, e.g. [Zr(tmtaa)Cl2 [66], [Ti(tmtaa)Cl2] [63]) over trans (octohedral, e.g. [Sn(tmtaa)Cl2] [20].\nConformations other than planar and saddle-shaped for dibenzotetraaza[14]annulene framework have been observed in a&nbsp;few cases only: [Ge(omtaa)Te] (inverted saddle-shaped [116], [Ru(tmtaa)(PMePh2)2] [90] and [Ru(omtaa)(PPh3)2] (Fig. 8 [93]), [Pd(tmtaa)] (Fig. 9 [97]) and [Pt(tmtaa)} [104] (step-like structure).",

            "abstract": "This review describes some current approaches in using metal compounds to module the response of tumors and normal tissues to cell killing by ionizing radiation. It is know that many tumors contain necrotic, oxygen-defficient areas which show diminished radiation sensitivity. Normal tissues contain mostly oxic cells; so antihypoxia therapies should be relatively tumor-specific. The biochemical role of oxygen is in fixing, or making permanent, the damage done to the critical DNA targed. Radiation can damage DNA either by direct interaction or indirectly by ionizing created in nearby water molecules. The resulting DNA state depends on a&nbsp;competition between oxygen for damge fixation and reducing species, such as hydrated electron or thiol compounds (\u00beSH), for chemical restitution ([10] and ref).\nApproaches to chemical modification include use of (1) \"electron-affinic\" sensitizers which act as oxygen mimetics; (2) thiol-binding agents which prolong life and action of OH+ radical that is the most cytotoxic water radiolysis product; and (3) DNA-binding agents which may inhibit repair processes [1].\nAn ideal radiosensitizer would be nontoxic to aerobic cells. The classic radiosensitizers are the nitroheterocycles as exemplified by nitrofurans and nitroimidazoles. Their nitro groups are \"electron-affinic\" and hence may interact with damage on DNA induced by radiation in a&nbsp;manner analogous to oxygen [1, 51].\nMetal complexes would appear to represent ideal candidates for studies of their potential sensitizing properties, but only few such studies have been carried out. Metal complexes which exhibit greater radiosensitizing properties in hypoxia may be diveded into three classes: (1) cisplatin and related Pt complexes; (2) metal (mainly Pt, Ru, Rh) complexes of nitroaromatic radiosensitizers; (3) complexes of early transition metal series which may act by electron affinity or thiol depletion.\nMost radiosensitization studies have been done with clinically used platinum compounds, namely cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin), carboplatin and iproplatin. When they are used in conjunction with radiation, they give beneficial results in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as in clinical trials [1, 29, 37, 51]. Some other neutral platinum complexes, possesing cis or trans configuration, were shown to be potentiators of radiation induced cell kill. The means by which the platinum complexes interact with radiation is not clear, but recent studies rule out an electron affinic and thiol depletion mechanisms. One assumes that the radiosensitizing ability of platinum complexes is related to their DNA binding [1, 29, 51]. Platinum compounds are not \"true radiosensitizers\" because they do not imply oxygen-mimetic or electron accepting mechanisms. Such compounds are proposed to be named modifiers or potentiators.\nThe metals which bind to DNA were suggested to be used as carriers for electron-affinic compounds. Some moderately promising results were obained in the complexes of platinum group metals with nitroimidazole ligands [1, 37, 51]. The non-platinum group metals have been investigated rather sparsely.\nThe emerging knowledge of tumor, cellular and molecular biology is providing a&nbsp;better understanding of the clinical results with the hypoxic cell sensitizers and novel approaches to radiation sensitization and protection [10].",

            "abstract": "Chromium was discovered in 1797 by Louis Nicolas Vauqelin, a&nbsp;French chemist. The element has valences that range from (-2) to(+6). Under environmental conditions chromium in compounds exists in the trivalent and hexavalent state [1]. Chromium was recognized as an essential trace element in 1959 [28]. The essentiality of Cr(III) was established examining rats fed a&nbsp;Torula yeast diet which proved to be Cr-deficient. Rats developed glucose intolerance which could be reversed only by addition of Cr(III) to the diet. Chromium deficiency in humans results in symptoms comparable to those associated with diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases [16]. The Cr(III) complexes potentiating the insulin action was called GTF (glucose toleranse factor). The yeast GTF has been found to be a&nbsp;low moleclar weight molecule comprised of Cr(III), nicotinic acid, glycine, glutamic acid and cysteine. Among the several possible mechanisms by which GTF migth act, in vivo and in vitro results suggest that the most likely mechanism is a&nbsp;direct enhancement of the insulin activity via facilitating its bonding to cellular receptors [29]. As Cr(III) was recognized as an essential element, dietary intake has been found to range from 13 to 56 mg [40]. However, in contrast to Cr(VI) it is still unanswered question on the level of Cr(III) toxicity [4]. Studies of Cr(III) cellular uptake have determined that much of the intracellular Cr(III) is associated with the nucleus. It has also been shown that Cr(III)-based supplements like Cr(III) picolinate can cause chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes (Tab. 1). The bioinorganic chemistry of Cr(III) ion is based on investigation of numerous Cr(III) complexes with ligands of biological relevance [1]. With few exceptions, they are six coordinate with the main characteristic of relative kinetic inertness in aqueous solutions.This, for example, rules out the possibility of chromium presence in the enzyme activity centre. Being a&nbsp;hard Lewis acid chromium(III) has an affinity towards oxygen and nitrogen donor ligands. There are several monomeric and dimeric species which may serve as models for GTF (Tab. 2, Fig. 4). As for over 30 years the investigators tried to isolate GTF without success, the view of non-essentiality of this ion received more support [10, 32, 36]. Recently, a&nbsp;candidate for the biologically active form of chromium, low molecular weight subsance (LMWCr) has been isolated by Yamammoto et. al. [69]. LMWCr is an oligopeptide with the molecular weight approximately 1500 which binds 4 chromium ions per molecule [Tab. 3]. The oligopeptide comprises of glycine, cysteine, glutamate and aspartate. Among various model compounds (Fig. 4) the trimer [Cr3O(O2CCH2CH3)6(H2O)3] was found to be active and was proposed for a&nbsp;treatment for adult-onset diabetes [73].\nIn conclusion, it appears very likely that four decades of intensive research on biological chromium resutlted in finding the answer to the question on the essentiality of this element. The \"new GTF\", i.e. the active chromium containing species, primarily functions as the activator of insuline receptors whereas the \"old GTF\" may serve rather as a&nbsp;readily absorbed chromium dietary supplement.",

This reaction is the key step in the synthesis of vitamin K and its derivatives.\nThe preparation of naphthoquinonea usually requires the direct oxidation of arenes by stoichiometric quantities of chromic acid/sulfuric acid [3-6]. The reaction can be also achieved by the use of Ce(IV) compounds and other transition metal compounds as oxidants [7-11] and with hydrogen peroxide [13, 14]. The other approach is to use Diels-Adler reaction between 1,3-butadiene and p-benzoquinone with the subsequent oxidation of the adduct formed [20, 21]. The indirect electrolysis with ruthenium compounds and dichromate as mediators were also applied in the process [25, 26]. In the previous work [34] we reported that the electrochemical oxidation of 2-methylnaphthalene in glacial acetic acid gives monoacetates, mainly 2-methylnaphthalene-1-acetate, but 2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-diacetate and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone were also formed This prompted us to investigate the electrochemical behavior of 2-methylnaphthalene-1,4-diacetate [38]. It is shown that the electrochemical oxidation of the compounds in glacial acetic acid yields 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone as a&nbsp;sole product. The process is irreversible and diffusion controled. The material and current yields of the process are 94% and 99%, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The essential biological importance of uracil and its thio-derivatives, as well as the relatively small size of the parent uracil molecule, have motivated a&nbsp;number of experimental and theoretical studies of this species. There are many axamples of biological processes in which the knowledge of the relative stability of different tautomers of one molecule can be very helpful in understanding the molecular mechanism involved.\nTautomerism of pyrimidine bases has been studied extesively in the past decades. Both theoretical [1-3] and experimental [3, 4] efforts have been directed toward the prediction of the molecular structure and properties of possible tautomers. 2-Thiouracil and 4-thiouracil can exist in six tautomeric forms with completed cyclic conjugation (aromatic tautomers). Non-ring conjugated tautomers also exist, but are likly to be little importance [5, 6]. 2-Thiouracil and 4-thiouracil can form four mono O-, S- or N-methyl derivatives, each of which can exist in three tautomeric forms. It has been realized that the relative population of these forms strongly depends on the environment [7]. In particular, the form dominating in the gas phase, or in the nonpolar solvents, may completely disappear in the crystalline state, or in the polar solvents and may be repleced by another tautomeric form. Theoretical calculations based on the quantum mechanical principles may certainly help to resolve the question of the relative stability of various tautomeric forms of thiouracils and to predict the relative gas-phase abundances of those forms. Because of the considerable size of thiouracils by quantum mechanical standard, only semiempirical quasi- ab initio methods have been applied so far.\nCrystallographic studies of nucleosides and nucleobases and their derivatives are informative [8, 9] and can be used as a&nbsp;basis for the theoretical evaluation of their electronic structures by a&nbsp;quantum-mechanical approach [10, 11].",

The sequence of events is presented, which led to this discovery [4, 1, 2], starting from a&nbsp;diffusion anomaly [4], caused by a&nbsp;non-uniform distribution of hydrogen in nickel cathodes. The late discovery of nickel hydride, as compared to palladium hydride discovered in 1866, is due to two reasons: a.) the limited penetration depth of nickel hydride [1, 2] Fig. 1 and b.) the high activity of gaseous hydrogen, necessary for a&nbsp;direct synthesis from the elements [21, 23, 25, 29]. This required the construction of a&nbsp;new high pressure equipment (Fig. 3), necessary for high pressures of gaseous hydrogen of the order 104 bar at room temperature [23, 25, 27-30]. These devices enabled not only the measurements of isotherms of formation and destruction of nickel hydride (Fig. 4) [29, 30], but also its kinetics under near equilibrium conditions [41, 21]. The thermodynamics of nickel hydride [23, 33, 34] is characterized, and the magnetic [45-50] and electronic properties are mentioned [51-58]. The new high pressure technique was the ladder for the discovery of superconductivity in palladium hydride [66, 67], as well as the way for preparation of new hydrides [68-72].

Sugar oximes possessing hydroxyimino group at first, second, third or fourth carbon atom of the pyranoid ring are well know. Here, we focus on the 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino derivatives of saccharides, because of the interest they have received. It is due both to the ease in preparation of 2-hydroxyimino sugars and their utility as substrates in synthesis of many important mono- and oligosaccharides structures.\nThe chemistry of the 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino sugars was mostly investigated by R. U. Lemieux and F. W. Lichtentheler.\nLemieux at al. [2,4] worked out a&nbsp;general method of synthesis of 2-hydroxyimino-D-glycopyranosides, which was higly a-stereoselective (nitrosyl chloride method). The addition of nitrosyl chloride to an acetylated glycal led to the formation of a&nbsp;dimeric adduct of O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-nitrozo-a-D-glycopyranosyl chloride, which reacted with the alcohol to afford a&nbsp;O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino-a-D-glycopyranoside. The derivatives of 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino glycosides were modified at C-2 to afford 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-a-D-glycopyranosides [10,11] and a-D-glycopyranosides [5-9], respectively.\nJeanloz [13], Van Heeswijk [15], Heyns [16], Paulsen [17], and Mallams [18-22] have employed a&nbsp;nitrosyl chloride pathway to the synthesis of some important biological compounds. Unfortunatelly, usage of more sophisticated donors or acceptors caused the reaction to be less stereoselective.\nLichtenthaler at al. [24-37] elaborated a&nbsp;different methodology of the systhesis of the derivatives of sugars with 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino structure. It starts with the conversion of starting saccharide into its 2-hydroxyglycal ester, followed by the three-step sequence hydroxylaminolysis \u00ae benzoylation \u00aephotobromination, which provides 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino-a-D-glycopyranosyl bromide, an useful synthetic intermediate in Koenigs-Knorr type glycosylation.\nOther methods of synthesis of hydroxyimino sugars consist both in reaction of the corresponding keto-derivative with hydroxylamine [38-45] or reaction of the suitable glycosyl bromide with alkylcobaloxime [49-51].\nNitrosyl chloride pathway was employed to the synthesis of N- and O-glycopyranosides with 2-deoxy-2-hydroxyimino structure of some amines and a-hydroxy-L-amino acid derivatives [54-62]. Obtained N- and O-glycosides were modified in many ways [63-66].",

            "abstract": "Fifteen years after the discovery of fullerenes the volume of work in the field of fullerene chemistry continues to expand at an ever-increasing rate. The electrochemical behavior of C60 and other fullerenes received considerable attention. Up to six reversible, one-electron reduction steps have been observed for C60 and C70, while only one, oxidation step at quite positive potential, has been detected. These results are in accordance with the theoretical predictions based on the energy levels distribution in fullerene molecules. The electron transfer processes are coupled with the ion-pair formation reactions. Heterogeneous reduction of C60 and C70 can be classified as an adiabatic process. The electrochemical behavior of higher fullerenes has been also reported. a&nbsp;significant differences in oxidation and reduction potentials have been observed for isomers of higher fullerenes.\nElectrochemical properties of fullerene derivatives depend on a&nbsp;degree of inductive effect and the number of adducts bonded to the fullerene cage. The electrochemical properties of five distinct types of derivative have been studied: metallofullerenes, inclusion complexes, transition metal complex adducts and inorganic and organic group adducts.\nMetallofullerenes are the derivatives where the fullerene encapsulates a&nbsp;metal atom within the closed carbon cage structure. The change of the electronic structure of the fullerene unit due to the transfer of electrons from metal atoms into the carbon claster results in a&nbsp;completely new electrochemical behavior that is different from that of all other fullerene derivatives and fullerenes themselves. Metallofulerenes are more easily to oxidize. Also, the first reduction process requires less energy than empty fullerene analog. a&nbsp;significant differences in electrochemical properties of isomers have been also observed.\nThe electrochemistry of inclusion complexes of C60 with cyclodextrin and calixyrene is similar to this observed for uncomplexated fullerenes. The complexation of C60 results in the slight shift of reduction potential toward more negative values. The charge transfer processes are usually coupled with dissociation of the complexes. The solubility of the inclusion complexes in water and other polar solvents is the main advantage of these systems.\nFor transition metal complexes derivatives of buckminsterfullerene the electrochemical properties are combination of the redox properties of fullerene cage and metal complex units. The reduction processes are attributed to the fullerene localized reduction since the oxidation takes place on the metal centers. It was found that coordination of metal shifts the reduction potential of C60 fragment to more negative potentials. The electron affinity decreases linearly with the substantial addition of each metal fragment. Electron transfer to these metal-C60 complexes causes dissociation of the metal units. The oxidation potentials are strongly affected by the metal nature.\nThe electrochemistry of organofullerenes is very similar to C60 with a&nbsp;negative shift in the reversible reduction potentials mainly due to the inductive effect of the adducts. Commonly, a&nbsp;three, five or six membered rings outside the fullerene cage are formed by 1,2 addition of organic compounds. For five member ring derivatives the electrochemically induced cyclopropane - fulleroid isomerization has been observed.\nAmong the C60 containing dimers only C120O exhibits the electrochemical behavior indicating the electronic communication between fullerene units. C120 dimer is unstable and after first reduction step decomposes with the formation of neutral C60 and C60- ion.\nThis paper reviews the results of the investigation of electrochemical properties of fullerenes and their derivatives.",

            "abstract": "The structure and features of different systems of fuel cell depend on the nature of used electrolyte. The main fuel cells are as follows: alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [2, 5]. Fuel cell reactions are listed in Tab. 1. Intense research programs are now realized in order to utilize PEMCs for transportation applications. The structure of PEMCs is shown in Fig. 1. [9].\nIn PEMCs the anode and cathode reactions occur on the platinum or platinum alloy electrocatalyst surfaces; the electrocatalyst is usually supported by carbon. Electrode surfaces contain 1 mg per cm2 or less [11]. Layers (thickness 180 mm or less) of perfluorinated sulphonic acid ionomers (e.g. Nafion\u00d2) are used as electrolyte membranes [16].\nThe overpotential of the pure hydrogen supplied PEMC's anode is low. the contamination of hydrogen by CO restricts the performance of the anode, because CO acts as an anode catalyst poison - Fig.5 [1]. Methanol-fed anodes operate at overpotentials as high as 0.3-0.4 V [22]. Oxygen reduction proceeds with rapid fall-off cathode potential. As current density is increasing, formed water disturbs the diffusion of oxygen to the catalyst surfaces [24].\nThe specific conductivity of the ionomer increases proportionally to the content of absorbed water [26]. The desired water content in membranes of fuel cells is usually supported due to humidification of reactant gases [28]. Reactant gases do not require external humidification, if very thin Nafion membrane (thickness 50 mm) cantain inside highly dispersed platinum. Pt crystallites catalyse the recombination of the crossover H2 with O2. The generated water humidifies the PEMC's membrane adequately [32].\nThe PEMCs are combined in stacks. They operate in the potential range linearly dependent on current densities of fuel cell electrodes - Fig. 10 [24]. The data [9, 21, 39, 40] collected in Tab. 2 shown that operating voltages of fuel cells in stacks are about 0.7 V. The efficiences of PEMCs, that operate at variables given in Tab. 2, are 40-50% [42].",

            "abstract": "The present paper gives an overview of the literature concerning the speciation of manganese in soil and solutions.\nThe problem of speciation was approached in two different aspects: as a&nbsp;problem of the separation of a&nbsp;definite chemical form of metal in the material under investigation with the simultaneous protection of separateness conditions of the residual forms and as problem of selecting an analytical method of determination of manganese in the prepared material, generally in solution.\nPossibilities of separation and determination of some forms of manganese: Mn(II), Mn(III) and Mn(IV) have been described in the literature in the last years. Different analytical methods have been proposed, spectrometry techniques above all; and among other things, the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) [12], spectrofluorometry [17], X-ray fluorescence analysis [18] and spectrophotometric analysis [19] were used for detection.\nThis work also reviews the mineralization method concerning manganese total in soils, rocks and sediments; likewise the prospects of the determination of Mn total content. So far, most investigations have examined the overall concentration of Mn total in soils and sediments, for example by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) [25, 26, 31-33] and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) [29].\nThe described literature data indicate dynamic and multidivectional development of research work in the field of speciation of manganese in soil and solutions in last years.",

Incorporation of radionuclides into biomolecules, and syntheses of radiolabelled compounds of high biological selectivity are a&nbsp;task for radiochemists working in the multidisciplinary field of radiopharmaceutical chemistry. The most commonly used radionuclide, 99mTc, owes this popularity to its both nearly ideal nuclear properties in respect to medical imaging, and availability from inexpensive radionuclide generators. Also numerous other radionuclides are widely used for medical imaging and therapy. Labelling of biomolecules with radioiodine and various positron emitters is getting increasingly important.\nThis review describes some chemical and radiochemical problems we meet while synthesizing and using 99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals and radioiodine-labelled biomolecules. Also represented are the recent developments in the design and use of the second generation radiopharmaceuticals based on bifunctional radiochelates. Several principal routes of fast chemical synthesis concerning incorporation of short-lived positron emitters into biomolecules are outlined as well.\nThe search for chemical structures of high biological selectivity which would be activated by slow neutrons, is related to the method of Neutron Capture Therapy, an interesting option in nuclear medicine.",

For these determinations 137Cs from nuclear explosions and natural 210Pb were used as tracers. Concentrations of natural radionuclides and heavy metals in ice deposited before industrial revolution were higher than in contemporary precipitation preserved as firn in high mountain and polar glaciers. This was due probably to volcanic activity, which was higher before the first part of the 20th century. Man-made contribution to the total atmospheric flux is now 3.5% for 226Ra, 12% for U, 7.4% for Pb, 0.11% for Cd, 62% for V and 5.8% for Hg. The mass of annual global wet precipitation, determined for the first time with radioactive tracers, is 5.7 x 1017 kg. In Poland, the lowest concentration of stable lead in human bones is now in highly industrialized southern districts. Lead level in medieval human bones from these districts reached up to 370 mg/g.

The experimental electron binding energies were much larger than theoretical estimations obtained at the Koopmans' theorem or self-consistent field levels. Moreover, photoelectron spectra of dipole-bound anions frequently display vibrational structure whereas a&nbsp;common view was that a&nbsp;dipole-bound anion may be regarded as a&nbsp;neutral molecule with the excess distant electron tethered so weakly to the dipole that the equilibrium geometries of the neutral and the anion are practically the same and therefore no vibrational structure was anticipated on the basis of Franck-Condon factors. In this review we summarize our recent work on electron binding energies in dipole-bound anions as well as on molecular relaxation upon electron attachment. We demonstrate that electron correlation effects contribute significantly to electron binding energies. In particular the dispersion interaction between the excess electron and electrons of the neutral molecule was recognized as a&nbsp;sizable stabilizing contribution. The molecular relaxation upon electron attachment was found to be significant and clearly detectable for hydrogen bonded clusters and small but still noticeable for some valence bonded polar molecules.",

Catecholborane is the hydroborating agent most often used in catalytic hydroboration. Rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, palladium and other transition metal compounds, including lanthanide iodides, are used as catalysts. The mechanism of catalytic hydroboration is discussed and schemes showing the catalytic action of Wilkinson's catalyst and lanthanide complexes are presented. The reactivity of alkenes in catalytic hydroboration decreases with the increasing substitution of the double bond. Generally, region-selectivities of the catalized and uncatalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and alkynes are similar, the boron atom being placed preferentially at the terminal position. The catalyzed reaaction makes possible higher selectivity by proper choice of the catalyst. However, the catalytic hydroboration of styrene and its derivatives may be directed to form preferentially the Markovnikov type addition products. Stereoselectivities of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed hydroboration of allylic and homoallylic derivatives are often opposite. The catalytic monohydroboration of conjugated dienes and enynes provides the 1,2- and 1,4-addition products depending on the catalyst. Enantioselective catalytic hydroboration of prochiral olefins is described and selected reactions providing products of 1-96 % ee are tabulated.

            "abstract": "This paper reviews the results of the investigation of electrochemical properties of fullerenes and their derivatives in solid state. These systems can be devided into three groups:\nThe electrochemical behaviour of crystalline films of fullerenes is very different that of dissolved species. The method of the film preparation strongly influences the redox properties and morphology of the film. Fullerene films are composed of small crystallities. The layers grown upon vapour deposition and electrocrystallisation are more uniform than the solution-coast films.\nThe redox behaviour of crystalline fullerene films in polar solvents is mainly affected by the size of supporting electrolyte cations. For small cations of alkali and alkaline-earth metals a&nbsp;rapid deterioration in the electrochemical properties of fullerene films is observed during repeated potential cycling. This behaviour of the layer is attributed to the formation of an electrochemically inactive cation intercalated compound or dissolution of the fullerene salt. The manipulation of the time window of experiment and the solvent nature can favour one of the above processes over the other.\nIn electrolytes with large cations (tetraalkilammonium and metal complexes cations) the reversible intercalation is observed. The reduction of C60 and layer doping with counterions result in changes of the crystallographic structure of the film microcrystals. In opposite to voltammetry of dissolved fullerenes, which exhibit multiple chemically and electrochemically reversible reduction curves, only the first two reductions of the film show chemical reversibility. The extending of the cathodic scan beyond the second reduction of the film results in the film dissolution.\nThe voltammetric behaviour of LB films and SAMs containing fullerenes and their derivatives are less influenced by the medium. a&nbsp;much smaller structural reorganization upon electrochemical reactions is observed. Redox properties of the fullerene moieties in these structures are similar to these observed in solution. Tightly packed C60 containing self-assembled layers exhibit resistive behaviour due to the resistant to ion incorporation.\nSignificant progress has been made in the electrochemically induced polymerisation of fullerenes and their derivatives. The oxidation of polythiophene with covalently bound moieties results in the formation of \"charm bracelet\" type conjugated polymer on the electrode surface. Fullerene unites incorporated into the solid structure retain their electrochemical characteristic. The redox active fullerene based films can also be formed by the electrochemical reduction of either the fullerene epoxide or of a&nbsp;mixture of C60 and o&nbsp;C2 in toluene/acetonitrile solution. The polymerisation is initiated by the active radical dianion C60O2-. The proposed structure for the polymer is ...-C60O-C60O-C60O-.... These films appear to be related to the conducting polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene, that are generally obtained by oxidation of corresponding monomers.\nThe polymeric network can also be formed through a&nbsp;two-component polymerisation that utilises the formation of covalent bonds between transition metal complexes and fullerenes. These films are insoluble in common organic solvents and adhere strongly to the electrode surface. They display very stable redox behaviour due to the presence of fullerene moieties in their structures. a&nbsp;significant decrease in resistivity in the potential region in which it is reduced is also observed. The electrochemical switching between the doped (conducting) and undoped (nonconducting) states involves both electron and ion transport within the film. The overall control of charge percolation through electroactive material is governed by the transport of ions. Laser ablation of some of these electrochemically formed layers results in the formation of C59-2nM (M = Pt and Ir) clusters.",

            "abstract": "Catalytic cleaning of exhaust gas Otto engines is the well known technique, commonly used, particularly in the environment concerned countries. In the half of the eighties, successful implementation of three-way converters (TWC) generated a&nbsp;demand for catalysts for Diesel engines, to meet the increasing requirements of standards for gas emission from moto vehicles.\nIn those days the problem of reduction of emission of particulates from Diesel engines seemed to be easy for solution by filtration and periodical regeneration of the filters or filter-catalysts. However, the problem turned out to be surprisingly sophisticated. On the other hand, industry offered a&nbsp;new generation Diesel engines which met requirements of the American (1991, 1994) and European (Euro i&nbsp;- 1993) standards. One may have expected that futher development would continue in the some way. Once more the expectations faild. In 1998, the standards accepted by the European Community Countries for 1999/2000 and those expected for 2005/2008 leave no illusions about the need for application of Diesel gas coverters in the future.\nThe study is a&nbsp;review of the latest development in the field of conversion of Diesel exhaust gas in the context of the currently valid and future legal regulations. However, only catalytic aspects are discussed. The solutions presented comprise combustion of particulates in monolithic flow-through oxidation catalysts and in Diesel particulate filters (DPF) equipped with a&nbsp;catalytic oxidizing coatings, or with injection of easy flammable organic substances before the filter, or with catalytic metal-organic fuel additives. Chemical composition and dynamics of Diesel soot formation are described. Moreover, impact of Diesel particlates on human health is outlined.",

            "abstract": "Liquid crystalline (LC) networks are fast growing group of materials with many possible applications. They can be divided into lightly crosslinked polymers with elastic properties [1, 16-18, 26-31] and highly crosslinked networks with very high molecular order [21, 25, 32-37]. Most of them contain typical, anizotropic, rigid mesogenic units known for other LC materials, but some of them exhibit mesomorphic properties although they do not possess any such units [7, 40-42]. Typical mesogenic groups can be incorporeted into main chains [29-31] or side chains [1, 16-18, 20-23] of polymers or both [26-28].\nThe density of crosslinking of LC polymers is difficult to measure [21, 23, 44-49], and the effect of crosslinking on LC properties is still not clear [50-53]. Although LC elastomers possess very interesting mechanical properties [7, 12, 15, 18, 25, 55-59] they are still too expensive for any lage-scale applications.\nCrosslinking of polymers in liquid crystalline state [58, 63] or applying mechanical stress [3, 12, 15, 59] to already crosslinked LC materials give unique possibility to achieve monodomain orientation of mesogens without any electric or magnetic fields.\nThe coupling between elastic and mesomorphic behaviour of LC elastomers leads to many useful properties like piezoelectricity [4, 68-72], second harmonic generation [76-78], opalescence [80, 81, 83] and good separation ability [85-87].",

Chemical engineering is not only a&nbsp;science discipline but also the art of matter transformation. The example of chemical engineering application is the scaling-up problem presented in Fig. 1. The main aim of the problem is the transition from the laboratory scale, where chemical reactions are considered, to large industrial scale where real processes are carried out. The structure of chemical engineering is shown pictorially in Fig. 2. The main pillars of the structure are physics, mathematics and economics, which are built on the ground of chemistry.\nHistory of chemical engineering science begins at the end of XIX century. There were two different ways of chemical engineering development - the German way and the American way. The two World Wars had the great mutual effect on the development.\nFirstly, chemical engineering was mainly empirical science. In the course of time it has become more sophisticated by introduction of the momentum, heat and mass transfer laws. There were many scientists and engineers who built the chemical engineering structure, for example Reynolds, Nusselt, Prandtl, Sherwood, Colburn, Dankwerts and others. Chemical engineering in Poland has been developed by professors: Hobler, Ciborowski, Serwi\u0144ski, Zio\u0142kowski and others.\nThe main branches of chemical engineering are: chemical reaction engineering, momentum transfer, heat transfer, mass transfer, simultaneous heat and mass transfer, bioprocess engineering and membrane processes.\nThere are many international, native and local chemical engineering organizations. The most important is AIChE - American Institution of Chemical Engineers. Many congresses, conferences and symposiums are held by the organizations. The research results are also published in various science and practical journals.\nThe future of chemical engineering may be seen developing in two directions - the filling of the so called \"white blots\" and working out new unknown processes.",

            "abstract": "Thirty five years after Hohenberg and Kohn discovered in 1964 that the electronic density r(r) can be used as the basic quantity in the rigorous formulation od the theory of electronic structure of matter, the modern density functional theory (DFT) has developed into an already mature discipline, which offers both attractive computational tools for applications in physics, chemistry and molecular biology, and a&nbsp;new conceptual framework for predicting and rationalizing preferences in chemical processes. Computational advances, originating from the other, almost as old historical development by Kohn and Sham (KS) in 1965, have demonstrated that the accuracy of the modern DFT software in the mostly ground-state applications has reached the level of the 3chemical accuracy 1, comparable to that offered by the sophisticated and prohibitively expensive traditional quantum chemistry methods, which explicitly determine the correlated N-electron wavefunction of a&nbsp;molecular system. The importance of these two branches of computational quantum chemical methods in modern chemistry has been recognized by the 1998 Nobel Prize for Chemistry [W. Kohn (density theory) and J.A. Pople (wavefunction theory)].\nThe Hohenberg-Kohn/Kohn-Sham theories have been generalized to thermal ensembles, multicomponent systems, spin and orbital paramagnetism, and superconductivity. The recent developments also cover the relativistic and excited-states theories, time dependent systems and the DFT for sybsystems, the latter being of paramount importance for the theory of chemical reactivity. The applications of DFT range from the ground-state properties of solids, through calculations on molecular systems of chemical/biological importance to high temperature plasmas. a&nbsp;combinations of DFT with molecular dynamics has prompted a&nbsp;spectacular progress in calculations on the ion dynamics in solids and the equilibrium structures of large molecular clusters with up to ~102 atoms. Very recently, progress has also been made in developing approaches behaving linearly with the number of electrons, which show promise of handling truly large systems consisting of ~103 atoms.\nThis spectacular success of the computational DFT is matched by its conceptual significance in chemistry. DFT gave a&nbsp;new impetus for developing novel, more reliable reactivity criteria and offered a&nbsp;new thermodynamical outlook on elementary chemical processes. It has soon been discovered that DFT provides the rigorous basis for defining many classical chemical concepts, which had originally been introduced on intuitive/phenomenological grounds, e.g., the electronegativity and hardness/softness characteristics of the electronic distribution in molecules. It resulted in more rigorous theoretical justifications of important rules of chemistry, soon to be followed by general variational principles for chemistry, which both elegantly united many facets of the electronic structure/chemical reactivity facts, and allowed for more accurate predictions of behaviour of chemical species.\nDespite this success of DFT, the knowledge of its basic theorems and generalizations is not widespread among chemists, to the best knowledge of the Author. Even in the university quantum chemistry course this subject is rarely mentioned, with the methodological core usually covering exclusively the traditional Hartree-Fock (HF) molecular orbital theory and its configuration interaction (CI) extensions. Little is known, for example, about the conceptual advantages of the Kohn-Sham orbitals over their HF counterparts, and the physical interpretation of the former. This review article, written in response to a&nbsp;kind invitation of this Journal Editor, attempts to fill this gap. This monographical survey covers the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and their ensemble extensions due to Mermin, elements of the Kohn-Sham and Kohn-Sham-Mermin theories, and rudiments on the crucial density functional for the exchange-correlation energy.\nThe discussion of the KS approach includes the KS equations for the optimum canonical orbitals and an analysis of the physical significance of the KS molecular orbitals, corresponding to a&nbsp;fictitious system of non-interacting electrons. The general form of the crucial functional for the exchange-correlation energy Exc[r] is summarized and the density scaling argument for its Local Density Approximation and the first nonlocal (density gradient) correction is presented. a&nbsp;general form of Exc[r] in terms of the exchange-correlation hole is introduced and specific examples of the non-local exchange and correlation functionals are given. Finally, some advantages of the related orbital dependent functionals Exc[{fi[r]}] used in the Optimized Effective Potential method are briefly mentioned.\nAn emphasis is also placed upon selected concepts for chemistry. In particular characteristics of the electronic \"gas\" in open molecular systems, covering the chemical potential (negative electronegativity), Fukui function, and the absolute measures of the chemical hardness (softness), are discussed in a&nbsp;more detail, including their behaviour in the zero temperature limit. It is argued that DFT facilitates a&nbsp;thermodynamical-like description of the polarization and charge-transfer phenomena in molecular systems, e.g., those accompanying interaction between reactants, adsorbate and substrate in heterogeneous catalysis, etc.",

Individual methods differ in their estimation of of the resultant bonds is more advanced. For reaction in question there is a&nbsp;lack of experimental parameters of activation. It is generally know, however, that activation energy for [2+3] cycloaddition of typical nitrones to alkenes are in range 13-18 kcal/mol. In the case of HF calculations the activation energy is clearly overestimated. Better results are attained by taking into account the electron correlation, in which the most accurate results are obtained using the advanced method MP4SDQ. The MP2 method considerably loweres the values of activation energy, which rectifies methods MP3 and MP4. Differing results are also obtained using density functional theory (DFT). As expected the most unreliable results were obtained using VWN functional. Only calculations close to the NLDA approximation allowed the attainment of reliable results. If the MP4 method is taken as the reference method, then the closed to this as regards activation energy values is the functional B3LYP. a&nbsp;much lesser influence on the description of the reaction under discussion is the type of basis set. The results of the HF calculations (without electron correlation) are equaly unreliable in the minimal STO-3G base, as well as in the more advanced 6-311G** base. So for a&nbsp;reasonably reliable description of the reaction of [2+3] cycloaddition between nitrones and alkenes, it seems imperative to apply the methods which take into account the effects of electron correlation.\nA similar relationship of activation energy regarding the type of calculation method applied can be observed in the case of reaction of parent nitrone with thioformaldehyde, isocyanates, acetylene and molecular oxygen.",

            "abstract": "Intramolecular hydrogen bonding which can be formed in the neutral or ionic forms of polyfunctional compounds strongly influences the simple proton-transfer reactions and tautomeric equilibria in the gas phase.\nThis effect, called internal solvation increases the proton affinities of nitrogen ligands, such as proton sponges with a&nbsp;rigid structure (Table 1), and diamines, amidinamines, bipyridines and amidinazines with a&nbsp;flexible conformation (Table 2) by 20-100 kJ/mol in comparison to monofunctional or model compounds [7-16, 19-21, 25, 27, 55]. In consequence diamines and amidinamines belong to superbases (PA>1000 kJ/mol) [14, 55, 63, 67].\nIn aqueous solutions, only proton sponges are strong bases. Due to strong steric effects, water molecules cannot open the ionic N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-N+ bridge in the proton sponges [25, 51-55]. Bidentate nitrogen ligands with a&nbsp;flexible conformation behave in solution similarly as monofunctional derivatives [56]. External solvation by water molecules eliminates the N\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-N+ bridge, changes conformation of the monocation (from cyclic to linear), reduces polarizability of the chain, and thus decreases the basicity.\nFor tautomerizing azoles, the internal solvation changes the pKT values by more than 2 pKT units in comparison to derivatives without this interaction [24]. Application of the Taft and Topsom equation (7) [43] to series of 4(5)-substituted imidazoles indicates that the internal solvation in the gas phase has similar influence on the transmission of substituent effects as the external solvation in water (Table 3).",

            "abstract": "Structurally simple aliphatic polyamines: putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) occur in the cells of living organisms (human, animals, plants and bacteria) in relatively high concentrations. These compounds participate in many living processes [1-4 and references therein]. The mechanism of their biosynthesis is well recognised [5,6], Scheme 1. High basicity of polyamines implies that in the physiological conditions they appear in the protonated form and thus can interact with the negative fragments of other biomolecules. According to the polyelectrolytic theory of Manning [31-38], structural changes of particular molecules in interactions with the other components of the system depend mainly on the charge of the reagents, however, this approach does not explain a&nbsp;high specificity of certain reactions. It has been recently suggested that apart from the charge, also the polycation structure seems to play an important role [39, 40]. Computer analysis of the potentiometric titration data allowed a&nbsp;determination of the stability constants of molecular complexes formed by polyamines and fragments of the nucleic acids. Analysis of the titration and the spectral data indicates that at least two active centers are needed to obtain a&nbsp;relatively stable adduct [62]. The thesis saying that the main sites of interactions are the protonated amine groups from PA and the negative or high electron density fragments of nucleosides or nucleotides (ion-dipole or ion-ion interactions) has been confirmed by the pH ranges of the molecular complexes occurrence, Fig. 2.\nIn nucleosides and nucleotides the main sites of metallation are the donor endocyclic N(3) atoms from the pyrimidine ring and N(1) or N(7) atoms from the purine ring. Phosphate groups of nucleotides are also effective centers of reaction. Polyamines change the character of the coordination dichotomy (mixture of isomers with the N(1) or N(7) coordination) observed in the metal-nucleoside (or nucleotide) systems. In general, with increasing length of the polyamine, the tendency to formation of heteroligand mixed complexes decreases and, interestingly, this tendency is exactly the opposite to that of formation of molecular complexes Nuc/PA. Already small changes in the polyamine length significantly affect their complex formation properties and reactions with metal ions or molecules in living cells [76, 77]. This explains the differences in the properties of biogenic amines and their biologically inactive homologues. In the ternary systems Cu/Nuc/Spm and Cu/NMP/Spm some interesting differences were observed in the coordination mode of the complexes. In the complex Cu(Nuc)(Spm) the metal ion was found to coordinate four nitrogen atoms from the polyamine in the equatorial plane and the N(3) or N(7) atom at the axial position (coordination structure of the square pyramid). In the system with the nucleotide, Cu(II) binds the phosphate group, while the polyamine is involved in non-covalent interaction with the donor nitrogen atoms from the purine or pyrimidine base [67, 78] and forms an adduct with intermolecular non-covalent complex-ligand interactions, Fig. 4. In the systems with nucleosides, copper ions inhibit the interactions of adenosine or cytidine with polyamines. On the other hand, spermine involved in the non-covalent interaction with a&nbsp;nucleotide base blocks the potential metallation sites of AMP or CMP, changing essentially the character of coordination.\nConsidering the role of the complexation processes in the above model systems, it should be added that formation of PA complexes with metal ions and fragments of nucleic acids is a&nbsp;factor ensuring homeostasis of polyamines in living cells. Reduction of the effect of diamine oxidase on the amines involved in the complexation processes increases their lifetime in living organisms [52].",

The mechanism of this reaction is assumed to be SN2 process involving nucleophiles of the >P-O- type and C-halogen electrophiles. On the other hand dialkyl phosphite anions are known to participate in aromatic [20 - 22] as well as aliphatic [ 23 - 27] SRN1 processes. In the literature one can find some examples of an unusual course of the Michaelis-Becker reaction. The reaction between bromotriphenylmethane and sodium diethyl phosphite was claimed to be a&nbsp;free radical process [28, 29]. It was shown recently [41 , 42] that the anions of the >P-O- type as well as >P-S- undergo reaction with a-bromocarboxylates and - phosphonates yielding debrominated products.\nThe anions of the >P-O- type are of special interest; they are nucleophilic ambident reagents, strong bases, and are suggested to be single electron donors [20 - 27]. On the other hand the compounds of the >P(O)H structure can act as proton or hydrogen [12, 13] sources; depending on the structure and reaction conditions.\nThe results of current investigations show that in the case of the carbon bromine bond, also bromine can be a&nbsp;target for nucleophilic attack by the phosphorus reagent of the >P-O- as well as >P-S- types with the release of the carbanion as nucleofuge. It was demonstrated [58] that according to the reduction potential of p-substituted benzyl bromides and the solvent used in the reaction of these starting materials and the nucleophilic reagent of the >P-O- type the formation of the P-C bond, debromination and/or dimerization occur.\nThe influence of light on the products distribution [ 56, 58] as well as the results of the free radical trap experiments [57] have resulted in a&nbsp;reasonable picture of the mechanism of the reaction between p-substituted benzyl bromides and >P-O- nucleophiles outlined in Scheme 16. The results of current research strongly speak for the X-philic substitution as the principal process in the reaction between bromoalkanes possessing the electron - withdrawing groups and >P-O- nucleophiles ( Scheme 16, eq a&nbsp;). This nucleophilic attack of the >P-O- anion on the bromine atom results in formation of carbanion , which, depending on the redox potentials, can participate in the proton ( Scheme 16, eq b ) and / or electron transfer ( Scheme 16, eq c ) processes producing debrominated products and / or dimers . The anions of the >P-O- type can act rather as a&nbsp;carbon radical trap and not as a&nbsp;single electron donor.",

Polymers of propylene oxide are formed in this case with Mn within the range between 6 000 and 12 000. They are mainly diols and they also contain the monol fraction. The chain transfer reaction to the monomer does not occur or its rate is strongly limited in the polymerization of some other oxiranes by potassium hydride. It allows to obtain the molecular weight of polyethers higher than that in the presence of the anionic initiators known so far. The Mn = 39 000 is found for example for poly(butylene oxide).\n",

            "abstract": "From the time selenium was discovered in 1817 by Berzelius, until the recognition in the late 1950s of its toxicity and, subsequently, its essentiality for humans, a&nbsp;large number of its properties have been elucidated. Apart from natural sources (mainly metal-sulfur minerals) selenium compounds can widely spread throughout the environment as a&nbsp;result of combustion of coals and its uses in the glass and electronic industries.\nNatural waters, soils and air are the most commonly studies environmental media. Selenium naturally exists in several oxidation states and in inorganic and organic forms. The inorganic selenium species most frequently found in waters and soils are selenite (SeO32-) and selenate (SeO42-).Selenites have high affinity for metal hydroxide and are adsorbed onto insoluble compounds. Under acidic conditions they are rapidly reduced to elemental red selenium. Alkaline and oxidising conditions favour the formation and stabilisation of selenate [5-10]. Several organoselenium compounds have been identified with direct Se-C bound including methylated species, selenoamino acids, selenoproteins and their derivatives. Inorganic selenium compounds can be transformed into volatile species such as dimethylselenide - (CH3) 2Se and dimethyldiselenide - (CH3) 2Se2 through microbial action [11-13]. These methylation reactions are considered to be detoxification steps, because methylated compounds are less toxic [14].\nSelenium has been recognised as an essential nutrient for humans based on its presence in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which affords cell protection against oxidative damage [17]. Its compounds also catalyse the reactions of intermediate metabolism and inhibit the toxic effects of heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium and mercury. The recommended daily dietary allowances of selenium for adult humans is in the range of 50 - 70 (g [24]. On the other hand, there is also some evidence that in higher concentration toxicity effect of this element can occur. The maximum recommended selenium concentration in drinking water is 10 mg/dm3 [4].\nAs physiological effect of selenium have been realised in recent years, there has been increasing interest in the trace determination of this metal. The analytical methods for selenium determination in different matrices have been recently reviewed [3,25-27].\nHowever, selenium reactivity and bioavailability depend not only on its total amount. Additional knowledge of the chemical forms and oxidation states in which this element exist is needed. Compared with the extensive investigations on total selenium or selenite and selenate determination, very little work has been done with organic selenium compounds, especially in foods [43-46]. Selenomethionine (probably the major form of selenium in cereals) is retained in tissue proteins to a&nbsp;much greater extent. Intake of other forms of selenium, such as selenite or selenocysteine will be excreted in the urine if it occurs in the excess [14,46].",

            "abstract": "The proton transfer reactions in solutions seem to be simple, yet a&nbsp;number of consecutive steps can be distinguished [1]. The useful tool in determining the mechanisms of these reactions was, and still is the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect [2-18]. Therefore the factors influencing the rate constants and then KIE of these reactions as: steric hindrance of reactants, polarity of solvents and symmetry of transition state were widely discussed 18-63]. The commonly acepted view on the deuterium kinetic isotope effects is that they are large when bulky substituents are crowded around the reaction site [19-21], and also the reactions are carried out in low polarity solvent [25-28]. However, there was found that even in polar aprotic solvents as acetonitrile large KIE values take place [26-28, 40, 41]. The KIE values are not very sensitive on the steric hindrance [18,56], showing in some extreme cases reduced KIE values [18, 53, 56], what is incompatible with previous papers [22, 23, 34-37, 40-52]. Likewise some other effects as \"scrambling effect\" simulating very large KIE are considered [29-38].\nThe products of proton transfer reactions between C-acids and strong organic bases in polar aprotic solvents in contrary to previous findings [22, 25] appeared to be highly dissociated into free ions [41, 67]. The reason and consequences of erroneous fulfillment of Benesi-Hildebrand [64] equation are discussed. It was essential to carry out the kinetic study of the proton transfer reactions, in particular those of low equilibrium constants in a&nbsp;BH+/B buffer. Then the association effect should be considered [68]. Also a&nbsp;number of homoconjugation constants for selected organic bases [68, 69, 69a, 69b] and equilibrium acidities of some C-acids [117] in acetonitrile solvent are given.\nThe study of proton transfer reactions in mixed H2O-Me2SO solution prevented the homoconjugation effects and gave the thermodynamic and kinetic acidity, what enabled to evaluate the intrinsic barriers or intrinsic reactivity [70-78]. To assess the aci-nitro behavior of C-acids the protonation reaction of 4-nitrophenylnitromethane carbanion at different pH values were performed [71, 72, 80-91].\nThe influence of residual water which cannot be removed completely from the reaction systems of C-acids and strong organic bases in aprotic solvent was a&nbsp;subject of interest for many years [29-32, 37, 40, 98]. After careful examination it appeared that the traces of water in reaction medium, in aprotic solvents, caused a&nbsp;marked decrease of reaction rate instead of its acceleration [97]. It was clamed that the reactivity of ion pairs is negligible compared to free ions [99-101]. However, in some cases the reactions are going via ion pair reagents with distinct differentiation of reactivity between loose and tight ion pairs [99, 107, 108]. Using literature values of the fractionation of cesium n-propoxide for ions and ion pairs [110, 111], 2.5 times larger reactivity has been found for ion pairs than free ions in proton abstraction from 1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1-nitroethane [109]. The recent progress in the study of proton transfer reactions indicates new aspects in understanding the mechanism and theory of these processes.",

As a&nbsp;ground for these definitions it is usually accepted that aromatic compounds are those cyclic p-electron systems which exhibit the following properties:\n(i) They are more stable than the non-cyclic analogues;\n(ii) Their bond lengths are intermediate between the typical double and single bonds;\n(iii) They exhibit special magnetic properties: in the external field the p-electron ring current is induced.\nSometimes an additional criterion is postulated: the aromatic systems react in the way to retain their p-electron structure.

            "abstract": "The mathematization of chemistry has a&nbsp;long history. In 1874 Brown, one of the great pioneers of chemical structure theory, prophesied that \" ... chemistry will become a&nbsp;branch of applied mathematics ... and enable to justify results obtained by experiment and predict entirely novel discoveries\". This prophesy was soon to be fulfilled. In 1875 the British mathematician Cayley enumerated both the isomers of alkanes and alkyl radicals based on the graph theory. He realized that chemical graphs could be used to present molecules because of the isomorphism that exists between such graphs and molecular structures [2]. This relation plays an important role in application of the graph theory in modern chemistry [3].\nIn the article a&nbsp;brief description of the results in the field of enumeration and generation of isomers is given. The connections between chemical terms and quantities of mathematical graph theory are shown [Tab. 2]. Illustrative examples [ Tab. 1, Fig. 2-6], are chosen and mathematical principles of the methods are presented [18-20]. Recent papers on enumeration of isomers are compiled [29-49, 51, 54, 55, 59].\nThe topological matrix in H\u00fcckel molecular orbital method is isomorphic with the adjacency matrix of molecular graph. Isospectral graphs within the H\u00fcckel molecular orbital method correspond to conjugated molecules having the same set of orbital energies and related physical and chemical properties [3, 60]. Therefore the generation of isospectral graphs may be used to find similar chemical compounds. The methods of such generation based on some quantumchemical and informative characteristics are described [Fig. 8-9, Tab. 3-4, 61, 62, 64].\nComputers enable today the practical use of the mathematical methods mentioned in the article. Even the personal computers are useful in the topic. Some calculations can be done on-line by Internet or with the use of commercial computer programs [27, 29, 52, 63, 64].",

            "abstract": "The review is focused on the problems of supramolecular assistance to molecular synthesis which means the employment of supramolecular interactions to control the chemical synthesis, i.e. to guide the regio- and/or stereoselective formation of covalent and/or mechanic bonds. Such an approach results from the tendency to mimic processes occurring in natural biological systems.\nThe special attention is focused on the recent achievements in this field, i.e. on the design of so-called intelligent substrates, which contain in their structure the requisite stereoelectronic information needed to self-assemble spontaneously into a&nbsp;supramolecular intermediate, which converts further into a&nbsp;desired final product after the formation of one or more covalent bonds. Among the unusual structures obtained using this synthetic paradigm, mechanically interlocked molecular compounds, i.e. rotaxanes, catenanes and their supramolecular precursors: psedorotaxanes, are described in more detail, as they display features of bistable chemical switches, and therefore evolve currently a&nbsp;great scientific interest due to their prospective applications in nanotechnologies.\nSeveral examples have been given of supramolecular assistance to other complex chemical syntheses, in particular of organic compounds, organo(cyclophosphazenes) and oligonucleotides, enabling to perform them quickly and selectively from polyfunctional reagents, without the necessity to use any protecting groups.\nIt has been emphasized that supramolecular interactions play a&nbsp;special role in guiding so-called self-replication processes of the molecules containing in their structure both reactive groups, able to undergo co-condensation, and complementary to those contained in the substrates supramolecular synthons (motifs), capable to form appropriately oriented ternary complexes with these substrates, in which the functional groups are in favourable position to interact towards the desired product.\nAn influence of spontaneous self-assembly of the substrates, preceding their linking via covalent bond(s), on regio- and stereochemistry of the occurring processes has been discussed, with the special attention being paid to the role of so-called templates (previously named matrices), determining the orientation of the substrates due to the stabilization of particular transition states. Several types of templates have been discussed: complementary hydrogen bonding, metal cations (alkali metal, transition metal), p-donor-p-acceptor interactions and various combinations of the above mentioned; the examples of the respective template-driven syntheses have been quoted.\nThe reactions of functional macrocyclic ligands, assisted by supramolecular interactions with the nucleophilic ion-paired co-reagents, have been only briefly mentioned and limited to the examples of the exchange reactions of benzo-crowns with substituents in aromatic rings, and of chlorocyclophosphazene-crowns, because these problems have been recently presented by us in detail in the review article [43] and book [59].",

            "abstract": "Recently, optical sensors (optodes) are very often applied in biomedical sciences and biotechnology in analytical methods which require high sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy. The methods consist in the transmission of analyzed radiation by means of an optical fibre from the source to the sensor, and then of the response from the sensor to the detector also in the form of a&nbsp;light signal at a&nbsp;changed wavelength. a&nbsp;chromophore indicator sensitive to changes in physicochemical properties of an analyzed substance that take place in the reaction system is immobilized on the surface of an optical waveguide.\nAdvantages of the optodes include, among other things, no need to use a&nbsp;reference signal, a&nbsp;very small size and weight, elasticity, a&nbsp;possibility of using distant measurements (up to 1 km) a&nbsp;simple sensor construction and low price.\nThese sensors can be used in the analysis of samples in both liquid and gas phase [1-4]. This is why they found application in the environmental protection to analyze groundwater and flue gases [5], in toxicology [6] and to test product quality in the food industry [7]. If an enzyme which catalyzes an appropriate chemical reaction or a&nbsp;co-immobilized enzyme with a&nbsp;sensor transforming changes in the concentration of a&nbsp;substance being formed or decayed as a&nbsp;result of the enzymatic reaction, is immobilized on the fibre surface, then also biologically important compounds such as glucose [8], fructose [9], urea [10], lactate [11], amino acids [12], as well as pH [57, 58] can be determined.\nIn the latest studies on the formation of optical materials, especially an organic chromophore immobilizer, researchers often use silane gel which is obtained by the sol-gel technique. In comparison to a&nbsp;high-temperature synthesis of silica glass, the advantage of preparing silane matrices by gelation is that the process requires very mild conditions. This is why an organic compound, e.g. a&nbsp;luminescence probe, introduced to the input sol is not degraded during the gelation process.\nThis paper describes the process of silane gelation in the classical approach according to Flory-Stockmayer's theory [16] and then using the percolation theory [Table, 17]. Further on, methods of silane gel formation based on the latest studies are presented [22-26]. Recent studies on the gelation process based on the excimer spectrum of a&nbsp;classical pyrene probe are discussed [31-34]. Results of the studies, on the basis of which changes were observed in viscosity and polarity of the fluorophore microenvironment during gelation, are quoted. The changes were measured by the ratio of intensities of respective peaks in the pyrene emission spectrum [36-38] or fluorescence anisotropy [39,41,42]. This paper presents also results of the recent luminescence research of sol-gel transition dynamics using other chromophores, e.g. rhodamine G6 [44,45], ruthenium complex [47], oxazine [48], 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone [49], 3,3-diethyloxadicarbocyanines [50] and quinine [51].\nThe silane gel has properties which are important and interesting from the point of view of its application, i.e. transparency, porosity, thermal stability, and ability to form different carrier forms, e.g. powder, film or fibre [1]. So, in the final part of this paper the examples of applications of these carriers in the newest probes, i.e. chemical optical sensors [57-63], biochemical optodes [64-72], and immunocolumns [75-77] are presented.",

            "abstract": "Of different subpopulations of G-coupled serotonin (5-HT) receptors, in the past decade the utmost attention has been focused on the 5-HT1A subtype. This review is concerned with the structure-activity relationships of some 5-HT1A receptor ligands belonging to the 1-arylpiperazine class.\nLiterature data show that NAN-190, MM-77 and BMY 7378 which contain a&nbsp;1-(o-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (1-MeOPhP) fragment have a&nbsp;very high 5-HT1A affinity and act as postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor antagonists [21, 25, 26]. It has been shown that the basic nitrogen atom and methoxy group in the arylpiperazine fragment are desired features of the structure for both the affinity and postsynaptic antagonism at 5-HT1A receptors, since (I) replacement of the 1-MeOPhP fragment by 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) causes a&nbsp;dramatic loss of the 5-HT1A affinity (cf. 1 vs BMY 7378, 2 vs MM-77, 3 vs NAN-190) (Fig. 6) [23, 32, 36, 37], (II) modifications of the amide fragment (cf. MM-77 and MM-55 vs NAN-190) (Table 1) have no significant effect on their functional activity; like NAN-190, MM-77 and MM-55 are postsynaptic 5-HT1A antagonists [36, 38], and (III) replacement of the 1-MeOPhP fragment by the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazino[1,2-a]indolo system results in a&nbsp;significant loss of the 5-HT1A affinity and a&nbsp;lack of in vivo activity (cf. 4 vs NAN-190) (Fig. 7) [36, 38]. Therefore it may be assumed that the 1-MeOPhP fragment present in the postsynaptic 5-HT1A antagonists plays a&nbsp;major role in the formation of a&nbsp;bioactive complex with 5-HT1A receptors.\nAnother 5-HT1A ligand, buspirone - a&nbsp;second-generation anxiolytic - which contains a&nbsp;1-(2-pyrimidynyl)piperazine (1-PP) fragment, is a&nbsp;postsynaptic 5-HT1A partial agonist. It is generally accepted that the buspirone molecule is recognized by the 5-HT1A receptor due to the presence of 1-PP [30, 31, 32]. In other words, the 1-PP fragment of buspirone fulfills the minimal structure requirements defined by Hibert et al. (Fig. 4) [30, 31] for the interaction with the 5-HT1A binding site, one being the presence of an aromatic ring, and the other the presence of a&nbsp;basic nitrogen atom at a&nbsp;distance of 5.2-5.7 D. On the other hand, the terminal imide moiety offers an additional site of interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor, which results in a&nbsp;greatly enhanced affinity of buspirone in relation to 1-PP [3, 15, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37]. The buspirone molecule is modified by replacing the 1-PP fragment with THIQ (compound MM199) (Fig. 6). Buspirone and MM199 are equipotent 5-HT1A ligands; moreover, MM199 has essentially the same functional profile at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors as does buspirone. Both these compounds are classified as partial agonists of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors [37]. Furthermore, like buspirone, MM199 shows an antidepressant- and an anxiolytic-like activity in animal models. Its effects are antagonized by (S)WAY 100135, a&nbsp;5-HT1A receptor antagonist, which suggests that potent antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of MM199 are mediated by activation of 5-HT1A receptors [50].\nThe obtained results permit a&nbsp;general conclusion that the basic nitrogen atom and the terminal bulky cycloimide moiety, but not the 2-pyrimidinyl group, are pivotal features of the buspirone structure, being directly involved in the formation of a&nbsp;bioactive complex with 5-HT1A receptors [37].",

The use of many simple or complex salts of DNA can be considered as oxidizing components in the compositions of energetic materials. On the basis of DNA structure it was deduced that it would be possible to prepare ionic as well covalent organic compounds with -N(NO2)2 group. These compounds can be energetic materials alone as well as salts of DNA with organic cations and as complexes with organic ligands. High degree of interest in the synthesis and properties of DNA, its salts and new compounds with -N(NO2)2 group has been recently observed in literature.\nMain factors which accelerate studies on the synthesis and properties of DNA derivatives are the potential of their applicability and also the progress in our knowledge. DNA is a&nbsp;strong acid, its anion possesses ambident structure:\n&nbsp therefore, two types of salts can be formed. Similarly, alkylation of DNA leads to N- or O-alkyl derivatives.\nMercury dinitramide Hg(N3O4)2 was extremely interesting . It is covalent compound (O-salt) in a&nbsp;solid state as well as in the solution in nonpolar solvents. In polar solvents it dissociates forming mercury (II) cation and N3O4 anion. Hg(N3O4)2 can be useful reagent in organic synthesis similarly to other inorganic derivatives of mercury .",

            "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) do not bring about a&nbsp;sharp toxical effect in mammalian organisms. However, owing to the tendency of PCBs accumulation in the environment, low biodegradability and potential dangerous consequences for human health generating in long-term period, the efforts leading to PCBs elimination from environment are reasonable. In spite of the discontinuation of PCBs production, there are still their emission sources, i.e. mainly electrical facilities filled in insulating fluid, which contains polychlorinated biphenyls of high concentration.\nIn this paper the bases of PCBs synthesis were discussed. The principle of nomenclature of working fluids produced on the base of PCBs and their main physicochemical properties were also given [8]. In the second part of the paper the structure and chemical reactivity of polychlorinated biphenyls compounds were discussed, in particular, their inert behaviour in nucleophilic substitution reactions [12,13]. Moreover, the theoretical bases of PCBs degradation methods including chemical, physicochemical and biological processes were described. It was emphasised that PCBs degradation methods and remediation of PCB contaminated materials are required to be environmentally safe.\nAn efficient degradation method of liquid and solid materials showing high PCBs concentration is their incineration in a&nbsp;special furnace [41,43] with precisely controlled technological regime as well as with the use of a&nbsp;plasma torch [48] to avoid dioxine formation via recombination of uncompleted combustion products. It was indicated that PCB contaminated petroleum derived products are of the secondary potential source of PCBs propagation in the environment. For this kind of products, catalytic hydrogenation appears [36] to be a&nbsp;particularly interesting means of dechlorination without destroing the initial material. Also the treatment of hydrocarbon mixture with colloidal suspension of metallic sodium offers an attractive dechlorination potential. The mechanism of this reaction is not well known. Probably, the reaction proceeds through aryne mechanism.\nAttempts to remediate PCB contaminated waters by means of electromagnetic radiation in the presence of suitable catalysts [52,53] were mentioned as well. Finally, biological degradation methods of PCBs removal particularly from contaminated water and sewage were described [60].",

These properties are used for definitions of quantative measures of aromaticity (indices of aromaticity) (Tab. 1). In principle they do not always predict the aromatic character in a&nbsp;uniform way. Additionally each of the used criteria is biased by some inadequacies or lack of generality. The energetic criterion defined as resonance energy or aromatic stabilisation energy measures the total aromaticity and strongly depends on the choice of reference states and/or reactions (tab. 3). The same is true for the magnetic criterion - exaltation of the diamagnetic susceptibility. Geometric parameters seem to be the most general and may be used for estimation of both local and global aromatic character. Each of the criteria may be used providing a&nbsp;proper reference state can be defined. Application of variously defined indices of aromaticity is critcally discussed.",

            "abstract": "Catalytic activity of soluble metal complexes in homogeneous hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons has been reviewed based on 86 articles.\nThe catalysts of different structural types (e. g. metal carbonyls, complexes containing coordinated arenes, allyls, dihydrogen ligands) as well as some complexes of the early transition metals (Nb, Ta) are catalytically active in reduction of aromatic rings of mono and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Where available, mechanisms of hydrogenation reactions have been presented. Most of the proposed mechanisms involve coordination of arene in an h4-mode. E. g. benzene hydrogenation requires coordination of the substrate as h6, h4 or h2-arene. Transition h6 \u00aeh4 leads to a&nbsp;noncoplanar C6 skeleton and a&nbsp;highly disturbed aromatic system lowers the aromatic resonance stabilization energy (bent arene) and provides a&nbsp;driving force for arene ring hydrogenation.\nFrom among studied complexes the highest activity in benzene hydrogenation has been observed in the presence of [{Rh(h5-C5Me5)Cl2}2] in homogeneous systems [28] and in the presence of a&nbsp;water-soluble complex [(h6-C6H6) 2Rh2Cl4] \u00a0[53] used in two-phase system [53].

            "abstract": "The reaction of organic compounds on solid catalysts can be accompanied by the formation of heavy by-products which can form a&nbsp;carbonaceous deposit on the surface and cause deactivation. Coke is an intractable, poorly defined material, changing in nature and composition with almost all possible reaction variables [1-14].\nStudying the location of coke and its nature requires sophisticated techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used to present coke directly (Fig.1) [17-26], while electron loss spectroscopy (EELS) [27] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [22, 29, 30] can provide analytical and structural information (Fig.2).\nIt is a&nbsp;well-known fact that strongly bonded species, containing carbon or sulphur, may induce complex changes in the structure of a&nbsp;metallic substrate. These changes may have an impact on the catalytic properties. The influence of coke deposition on catalyst structure was studied by means of the X-ray diffraction method (XRD). The evidence of internal coke ( coke deposited inside the channel system) is given by XRD patterns [31, 32]. 129Xe NMR is also a&nbsp;technique which can provide information about the location of the coke [44-50].\nCoke produces a&nbsp;decrease in catalytic activity by two mechanisms: active site suppression or pore blocking. Both deactivation modes may occur simultaneously, although one of the two mechanisms is usually predominant. The loss of sorption capacity of coked catalysts (Fig.3) can help us to find out which deactivation mode has occurred [31, 37-42]. The increase in sorption capacity with increasing regeneration time corresponds to a&nbsp;successive removal of coke [45].\nThe technique of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) with either evolved gas (Fig.6) or gravimetric analysis (TGA) is often employed to investigate coke deposition on catalysts. Details of the proximity of coke to metal and nonmetal sites or the nature of coke are then inferred from the position of peaks in the resultant TPO profiles [21, 52-70]. The shape of these profiles can be affected by coke particle size and morphology [71, 72]. Currently TPO is performed with the following detection methods: determination of CO2 by a&nbsp;thermal conductivity detector [53], quantification of CO2 with a&nbsp;mass spectrometer [55, 60], methanation of CO2 [56], monitoring temperature increment above a&nbsp;reference sample in differential thermal analysis (DTA) equipment [29, 32, 37, 61] or measurement of weight loss in thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) equipment [49, 62].Thermograms of fouled catalysts can be divided into distinct regions. This indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of coke formation. Relatively less bulky carbonaceous compounds, which desorb at lower temperature range are termed 'soft coke'. More bulky carbonaceous compounds, which desorb at higher temperature, are referred to as 'hard coke' [32, 49].\nIn recent years, 13C NMR in conjunction with proton cross-polarization (CP) and magic-angle spinning (MAS) has emerged as a&nbsp;powerful tool for studying the nature of coke formed during hydrocarbon conversion over catalysts [15, 29, 45, 48, 79, 81]. Thanks to this method, valuable information such as the state and mobility of adsorbates, details of the regulated guest/host interactions [48] and the nature and distribution of the coke can be obtained [83]. 13C NMR has the unique ability to directly determine the distribution of aromatic, aliphatic and other carbon types present (Fig.7) [45]. IR spectroscopy has also been used to obtain information about the nature of the species present in the coke deposited on different zeolites [31, 37, 79, 84, 85] as well as on other catalysts [86]. The selective removal and transformation of carbonaceous compounds during reactivation were examined by means of IR combined with GC, TGA and NMR spectroscopy [45].",

            "abstract": "Many species of cyanobacteria forming blooms in eutrophic waters produce toxins. They are cytotoxins, neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatotoxins [1-10]. The hepatotoxins can be divided into microcystins and nodularins, cyclic hepta- and pentapeptides respectively. About 60 microcystins have been characterized and the most common is microcystin-LR (Fig. 1), but their chemical structure may be also different [3, 4, 9, 12]. Since a&nbsp;long time cyanobacterial toxins have been the reason of lethal poisonings of wild and domestic animals and health problems of humans in different regions of the world [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 13]. In 1996 in Brazil about 60 haemodialysis patients died after getting a&nbsp;lethal microcystin dose intravenously [14, 15]. The most frequent signs of poisoning are anorexia, general weakness, diarrhoea and vomiting [5]. Microcystins repeatedly uptaken by organisms in trace amounts contribute to the development of cancer as a&nbsp;result of their inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A [17]. There are epidemiological data indicating high rates of cancer in China due to long term exposure to cyanobacterial toxins in water [20]. World Health Organization proposed 1 microgram per litre as a&nbsp;guideline value for maximum acceptable level of microcystin-LR or its equivalents in drinking water [13]. Microcystins are chemically very stable and can not be decomposed by acid, alkaline or boiling. In field conditions their degradation is minimal [21]. They are also difficult to decompose in water treatment processes. Conventional water treatment methods are not sufficient, while activated carbon filtration or ozonation makes them more effective [23], but still trace amounts of microcystins pass the full-scale treatment [22]. Many methods of degradation or chemical modification of microcystins have been devised. Unfortunately, despite large body of research work cyanobacterial toxins are still dangerous, especially in drinking water reservoirs [21]. In Poland, the cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water reservoirs constitute a&nbsp;serious problem, especially for large agglomerations. For instance in summer 1993 in Sulejowski reservoir being a&nbsp;drinking water source for the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a the microcystin content in a&nbsp;cyanobacterial bloom was in the range of 40 - 117 mg/g dry mass of phytoplankton [6], reaching in the following years the value of 427 mg/g dry mass of phytoplankton, which was in the years 1995 and 1996 on the average 5.7 mg/L [9]. In the samples gathered in 1996 in Jeziorsko and Zalew W\u0142oc\u0142awski the average microcystin content was around 300 mg/g dry mass of phytoplankton [9, 10]. The presence of cyanobacterial toxins in Polish lakes and water reservoirs establishes new problems for Polish waterworks and laboratories dealing with water quality analysis [9]. This article contains many hints on construction of experimental set-ups for the determination of cyanobacterial toxins in water reservoirs, in particular sampling methods [24], choice of filters for separation of cyanobacterial cells [31], parameters in sample enrichment by means of solid-phase extraction [33, 35, 37] and analysis with high performance liquid chromatography [31, 35, 42], detection methods [44 - 46, 50], etc.",

            "abstract": "A review of current textbooks on the teaching of chemistry allows us to state that an ever-growing number of them are not only very thoroughly illustrated, but are supplemented by many didactic media. The elements supporting the textbook should be treated as unique elements added at the time that the text itself was already in existence. Quite a&nbsp;different teaching approach is found in the case of textbooks created from the outset with the idea of using many medial codes of presenting information and having a&nbsp;unitary structure with specially prepared supporting media (slides, overhead transparencies, videocassetes). In the situation where the supporting media comprise the fundamental element of the audio-visual textbook, taking over a&nbsp;considerable amount of its content, the preparation of the appropriate materials takes on the central role in creating the book itself.\nPreparation of a&nbsp;textbook fulfilling the above mentioned criteria encounters difficulties primary of a&nbsp;technical nature. The hope for overcoming them lies over more often in multimedial textbooks. Working with multimedial textbook of this type should place the student in a&nbsp;research situation, creating conditions for conducting independent reseach - seeking answers to posed questions and providing solutions to theoretical and practical problems. Substitution of the traditional textbook with multimedial one opens several hitherto unused avenues of action made available through the new educational technology.\nIn Poland, multimedial textbooks have yet to be developed, which would be devoted to the teaching of chemistry at the high school and junior high school level (from 13 to 18 years) and meeting the standards of the of the curriculum. These considerations have resulted in our developing research aimed at an evaluation of the effectivness of chemistry teaching supported by multimedial programs. The latter are aimed at intellectual and manual motivation of the students through emotional engagement and the way they reinforce information retention and provide acceptable methods of systematizing information elicited by the structure of the multimedial programs themselves.\nIn considering the resuts of our research, confirming the possibility of a&nbsp;considerable improvement in the effectiveness of teaching natural science subjects by means of multimedia, we undertook activities aimed at developing multimedial textbooks for the teaching of chemistry at various educational levels. This undertaking of considerable scope is initiated by the textbook Chemistry with Elements of Ecology by H. Guli\u0144ska and A. Burewicz, aimed at the high school level of teching.\nThe textbook Chemistry with Elements of Ecology is composed of three parts (each on two CD-ROMs) and contains the following subject area groups: Part 1 - \"Chemistry Fundamentals\", Part 2 - \"Types of Inorganic Compounds\", Part 3 - \"Carbon and Its Compounds\"",

It was covered in 12 lessons during 6 weeks, combining two 45-minute lessons each week. 18 students took part in the project.\nDuring the first session the students got acquainted with the work methods, split into three groups and answered the preliminary questionnaire. During the second session the students received the following pigments by themselves:\nblue - Prussian blue (Fe4[Fe(CN) 6]3).\ngreen - malachite (CuCO3Cu(OH) 2),\nwhite - barium sulphate(VI) (BaSO4) or titanium(IV)oxide (TiO2),\nred - iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) or red lead (Pb3O4),\nyellow - lead(II) chromate(VI) (PbCrO4).\nIn the third and fourth sessions they made the following paints from the previously received pigments:\nwater-colours (group 1),\noil-paints (group 2), and\ntempera (group 3),\nand prepared appropriate undercoats for the paints. In the fifth session each group used the paints to paint whatever they desired. At the same time the students widened their knowledge of naturally available pigments, chemical and physical properties of the undercoats, nature of light and colours, history of painting and well known painters who used water-colours, oil-paimts and tempera. The students also conducted interviews with painters and visited an art gallery.\nDuring the sixth session they summarized the results in each group, shared information about the methods of preparation of the various kind of paint and filled in the questionnaire. The students' paintings were also exhibited.",

            "abstract": "Cancer chemotherapy over twenty years has been under extremely intensive investigation. Failure in the treatment of neoplasms is due to characteristic fe-atures of cancer cells. Their structure delays and decreases the efficacy of drugs administered orally or intravenously. Therefore, greater emphasis is placed on the development of new molecular studies. The development of particular molecular diagnostic methods is based on new advances in immunology, genetics and nuclear medicine.\nNuclear medicine concentrates on the diagnostics and treatment of various diseases, including neoplasms treated by means of radiopharmaceuticals [5]. The isotope most commonly used as a&nbsp;source of g radiation for radiopharma-ceuticals is technetium (99mTc). The complexes of this radiotracer (e.g. 99mTc-HM-PAO - Fig. 1, 99mTc-CB-PAO - Fig. 2, 99mTc-ECD - Fig. 3) are widely used for brain imaging. These compounds indicate areas of normal blood supply in the brain, but do not enter hypoxic tumour cells.\nThe differences in oxygenation level between normal and cancer cells is key strategy used not only in the diagnostics, but also in the treatment of neoplasms. Some compounds [quinone antibiotics (mitomycin C - Fig. 4), nitroimidazoles (metronidazole - Fig. 5, misonidazole - Fig. 6), tirapazamine - Fig. 8 are known as hypoxia selective agents activated in low oxygen concentrations [8-10]. Another strategy used in anticancer therapy aims at the inhibition of angiogenesis in the tumour [2-3]; other methods limit the growth of tumour - these include use of inhibitory enzymes such as telomerase inhibitors (phosphorothioate oligonucleotides - Fig. 13, cisplatin - Fig. 14) [15-22] and polyamine metabolism inhibitors (DFMO - Fig. 16, MGBG - Fig. 17) [23].\nValuable antineoplastic drugs originate from natural sources. Currently, the derivatives of acronycine - Fig. 26 and spongiostatin - Fig .27 are being investigated. Natural compounds with a&nbsp;documented anticancer activity include, for example, taxol - Fig. 23, etopozide - Fig. 24A and tenipozide Fig. 24B [24-25, 27].\nNew directions in the research of new compounds for use in the diagnostics and treatment of neoplastic diseases are closely related to the development of molecular studies, which offer explanation of complex patophysiology of tumours on molecular level. Also. medical chemistry plays an important role in modern investigation methods, such as molecular modelling.",

            "abstract": "The preparation of optically active sulfoxides, useful chiral auxiliaries and synthetic building blocks is reviewed. Beginning with the progresses in the non-oxidative synthesis of chiral sulfoxides [6-11], the main part of the survey is devoted to the advances in stereoselective oxidation of the easily available prochiral sulfides.\nFirstly, the diastereoselective oxidation of sulfides containing other chiral center is discussed. Remarkable selectivities were obtained in the oxidation with MCPBA [13, 14], t-BuOCl [17], and (NaOCl, cat. TEMPO) [19-21]. In the next part the enantioselective oxidation processes are considered. The material is organized according to the character of the oxidant: chiral-stoichiometric methods and chiral catalytic methods. Among stoichiometric chiral oxidants, some of the most important are the Davis oxaziridines. An essential improvement in enantioselectivity was gained by the application of N-(phenylsulfonyl)-3,3-dichlorocamphoryloxaziridine [27], [(8,8-dimethoxycamphor)sulfonyl]oxaziridine and ethylene ketal of the respective 8-oxocamphor derivative [29, 30]. Much progress was also observed in oxidations with the Ti(IV)-supported chiral reagents. The Kagan and Modena methods were further elaborated. The highest e.es were observed using Ti(Oi-Pr)4/DET/H2O in 1:2:1 ratio [33] or Ti(Oi-Pr)4/DET/i-PrOH (1:4:4) + molecular sieves [34], both with cumyl hydroperoxide. The non-linear enantioselectivity effects (NLE) were found for these systems [36] as a&nbsp;proof for involvement of the chiral dimeric Ti-species. Uemura made an important modification to this oxidant by replacement of diethyl tartrate with Binol [44]. Also chiral 1,2-diols and C3-symmetric triols were used as chiral inducers with the Ti- supported system [46-48]. The other approach exploited chiral hydroperoxide obtained via biooxidation of hydrocarbon. Thus prepared oxidant gave enantioselective sulfoxidation with ca. 80 % e.e. [51].\nIn the field of catalytic sulfoxidations an important advancement was made by Bolm and Binewald who discovered the system active even at the 0.01 % mol level of chiral inducer. The catalyst was in situ formed from vanadyl acetylacetonate and (S)-(-)-N-(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)tert-leucinol and 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide was applied as a&nbsp;stoichiometric oxidant. The results attained were within 70-80 % e.e. level for simple alkyl aryl sulfoxides, [57] and over 91 % e.e. for the oxidation of di(tert-butyl) disulfide [59]. The catalytic system was further optimized and 75-95 % e.es were observed for the oxidation of thioanisole, 2-aryl-1,3-dithianes and 1,2-bis(arylthio)ethanes [61]. The other successful catalytic oxidant was the Uemura system (Ti(Oi-Pr)4/Binol/H2O, 5 % mol of Binol). In this version the system gave truly enantioselective oxygen transfer (98 % e.e.) [64].\nMany papers have been published on the application of the biological oxidants and the use of such methods is a&nbsp;feasible alternative to the chemical ones [12, 66, 67]. In particular, the microbiological systems containing fungi Helmithosporium were successfully applied for the preparative oxidation of prochiral thioketals and thioacetals, which could not be oxidized by purely chemical means [71]. Also various bacterial strains of Pseudomonas sp. were used and, e.g. hexyl methyl and cyclohexyl methyl sulfides were oxidized to the respective sulfoxides with high enantioselectivity [77]. Bacterial cyclohexanone monooxygenase was studied most widely among all the purified enzymes used in sulfoxidations [67, 78-85]. Asymmetric sulfoxidation was also investigated with hydrogen peroxide and vanadium bromoperoxidase and high enantioselectivities were obtained particularly for cyclic sulfides and those having a&nbsp;carboxylic group [88].",

            "abstract": "Among many methods of asymmetric synthesis, the second-generation reactions i.e. the ones applying chiral auxiliary to generate new chiral centers are the most popular and widely used. In the last two decades many new and highly effective chiral auxiliaries were described. Bornane-10,2-sultam, introduced by Oppolzer and co-workers [1], is one of the most popular and most effective in generating new chiral centers.\nUtility of bornane-10,2-sultam is due to:\n- simplicity of a&nbsp;method of its synthesis from the natural, cheap source - camphore (Scheme 1) [2-9], - high yield of connecting to prochiral substrates (Scheme 2), - almost quantitative asymmetric induction, - straight-forward removal of the formed product from bornane-sultam, which does not cause the loss of chirality at a&nbsp;new chiral center , - its high recovery after removal of product and possibility of multiple applications.\nOne of the most popular reactions studied in asymmetric synthesis is aldol condensation. This reaction was also studied with application of bornane-10,2-sultam (Schemes 4 and 5, Tables 1 and 2) [18-21]. Depending on the type of used base and Lewis acid either pure \"cis\" or \"trans\" isomer can be obtained. The chemical yields of the reactions were also high (50\u00f790%)\nN-acylated derivatives of bornane-10,2-sultam have been revealed also as facile precursors of chiral alkylated carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols (Schemes 7 and 7, Tables 3 and 4) [10, 15, 22, 23]. Diastereoisomeric excesses were in many cases above 99% and chemical yields were also very good (in most cases above 80%). Alkylation step can be also applied for asymmetric synthesis of a-amino acids (building blocks of peptides) but it is necessary to use N-[bis(methylthio)methylene]glycine methyl ester for acylation of the sultam. Quite nice selection of amino acids in optically pure form can be obtained by this method (Schemes 8, Table 5) [24-31].\nOther possibilities of the sultam usage arise from nucleophilic and electrophilic amination reactions (Schemes 9-11, Tables 6-8) [32-43]. These methods were applied to obtain amino, azido, hydrazino and N-hydroxyamino acids with high chemical yield and optical purity.\nApplications of bornane-10,2-sultam derivatives with a,b-unsaturated side chain are also very wide in asymmetric organic synthesis. One of the most popular reaction involving unsaturated compounds is Diels-Alder's cycloaddition. (Scheme 11-13) [6, 44-48]. Cyclic compounds formed during this addition are mostly endo-structures. Stereoselectivity is very high (higher than 90 %) and depends on a&nbsp;type of Lewis acid used (Table 9). Another interesting precursor in this kind of addition reaction seems to be the sultam derivative obtained by the modification with glyoxalic acid [49-53]. Its application can lead to piran derivatives and substrates of sugar moieties (Scheme 14).\nN-acylated with a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids sultam derivatives are also good substrates for carbonyl compounds stereoselectively substituted on a- or/and b-carbons (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids) as well as alcohols. For preparation of optically active a,b-disubstituted compounds either Grignard's reagents (Scheme 15, 16 and Table 10) [60-62] or Gilman's reagents (Scheme 17, 18 and Table 11) [62-65] can be applied with diastereoselectivity in range 70\u00f795 %.\nOther possibilities of the \"unsaturated\" sultam derivatives usage arise from reactions with \"hydrogen sources\" or oxidation agents. Asymmetric hydride addition (Scheme 19 and Table 12) [66, 67] or catalytic hydrogenation (Scheme 20 and Table 13) [68] leads to a,b-disubstituted chiral compounds with good yield and stereoselectivity. Oxidation of double bond, on the other hand, is facile method for obtaining 1,2-diols - superior substrates for ketones, acetals and sugars (Scheme 21 and 22) [69-73].",

The van Oss and co-workers' approach to the interfacial liquid-liquid and solid-liquid free energy used for the energy determination has been described. This approach treats the surface free energy of a&nbsp;solid and a&nbsp;liquid as the sum of the Lfshitz-van der Waals and Lewis acid-base components. The acid-base component of the surface free energy depends on the electron-acceptor and electron-donor parameters of this energy. Different determination ways of the surface free energy components and parameters of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic group of the surfactants are shown. The usefulness of the Young equation and adsorption data of n-alkanes on solid surface for determination of the Lifshitz-van der Waals component and electron-acceptor parameters of the acid-base component of the hydrophilic group of the surfactants is presented.\nOn the basis of the surface free energy components and parameters of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic group of the surfactants and recently modified DLVO theory, the free energy of interaction between molecules or ions of the surfactants through the water phase and the free energy of removing surfactant molecules or ions from the water phase to air or oil phase can be predicted. The modified DLVO theory treats the interaction between molecules or particles through the liquid phase as the sum of Lifshitz-van der Waals, acid-base and electrostatic interaction components, which details are described for the systems including ionic or nonionic surfactants. The free energy of interaction can be used for prediction of the standard free energy of adsorption and micellization of the surfactants if the contactable area of the molecules or ions of the surfactants is known. Different ways of the contactable area between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic group of the surfactants and between groups and water molecules are presented. The calculated values of the free energy of interactions of the surfactants through water phase are compared to the standard free energy of micellization and the standard free energy of the adsorption of surfactants at water-air (oil) interface. For this purpose the determination of the standard free energy of adsorption from isotherms of adsorption of the surfactants and their standard free energy of micellization is also described.",

            "abstract": "The crystalline molecular sieves comprised almost exclusively microporous materials (zeolites and zeolite-like materials). The pore diameter of this materials was mostly in the range 0,3-0,8 nm. Despite a&nbsp;very narrow range of this diameter, which limits the number of molecules to be applied, the crystalline molecular sieves have attained a&nbsp;great commercial importance for many industrial processes (selective adsorption, ion-exchange, catalysis). The attention of many research groups was focused on syntheses of larger pore structures accessible for bulkier molecules. It was not sure, however, whether such structures could be achieved and if so, whether they would be satisfactory stable to be applied for practical purposes. The successful syntheses of crystalline structures of VPI-5, JDF-20, Cloverite, and UTD-1 indicated that extra-large diameters above 1 nm could be obtained. The structures, on the other hand, appeared not very stable and not easy to be synthesized and modified. Therefore, they have not been commercially applied. The important milestone in modem history of the molecular sieves was discovery of novel family of mesoporous, well organized materials in early ninetieths. This new family of the molecular sieves have been presented independently by Mobil and Toyota at the 9th International Zeolite Conference in Montreal. The first examples of the materials consisted exclusively of silica. Soon later the aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves have been presented and then many other chemical compositions have been employed for synthesis of mesoporous molecular sieves. The materials of this kind are generally called M41S. The principle of synthesis of these materials shows some similarity with the preparation of zeolites and zeolite-like materials in respect to employing of the organic compounds as structure directing agents. The role of a&nbsp;template agent plays usually surfactants such as long alkyl chain amines, which form micelles in a&nbsp;solution. The micelle aggregates are then surrounded by inorganic precursors and the well organized array of voids (e.g. tubes) filled with surfactant molecules are formed due to condensation of an inorganic phase. The organic compounds are removed from the pores mostly by means of thermal treatment. a&nbsp;variety of surfactants applied allows to prepare various structures of different pore sizes (2-10 nm). The growing family of mesoporous molecular sieves contains many unique structures. The most common are: the hexagonal unit cell MCM-41, cubic MCM-48, lamellar structure MCM-50, although the number of defined structures is to date many times higher. Contrary to zeolites and other microporous molecular sieves the M41S are not crystalline materials. The XRD indicates usually only one or few reflections at very low range of 2-theta angle. The mesoporous molecular sieves show very high surface areas (usually above 1000 m2/g) and their adsorption/desorption isotherms of type IV often indicate a&nbsp;hysteresis loop. The transmission electron micrographs indicate a&nbsp;pore array in the lattice image. It has been hoped that the novel materials would show a&nbsp;similar catalytic activity as zeolites. These expectations have not been proven satisfactory so far. The catalytic activity of aluminosilicate mesoporous materials resembles rather activity of the amorphous aluminosilicates. The always growing variety of mesoporous structures and of their chemical compositions provides a&nbsp;chance of finding the materials of high and stable catalytic activity. The pore system of this materials is widely studied as a&nbsp;support accommodating the introduced catalytically active compounds. The mesoporous molecular sieves can be used for many other applications such as adsorption (storage of gases), matrices for microelectronic and optical devices, active fillers for polymers etc.",

            "abstract": "The thermodynamic information given by solubility is very poor as the activity coefficient of the solute a&nbsp;can be calculated only (see Eqs (1) and (3)). To obtain more complete information a&nbsp;method of precise measurements of vapour pressure over saturated solutios has been elaborated [2]. The activity of the solvent B can be derived from vapour pressure data and the excess Gibbs' energy along the liquids can be determined with no adjustable parameters [10] as shown in Fig. 4. Theoretical equation for the activity of solvent in saturated solutions as well as for the solubility have been deduced [7]. The activity and the solubility depend on two constants l and b. The methods of determination of the constants from vapour pressure and solubility data are given [10]. The knowledge of l and b permits the calcuation of excess functions of mixing in saturated solutions [8] by Eqs (20)-(23). The analysis of excess functions gives evidence of the existence of a&nbsp;short-range order, i.e. a&nbsp;correlation of molecular orientations in the liquid A. The destruction of the correlation by mixing with the an inert solvent involves positive contributions to the excess enthalpy as well as to the excess entropy. The effect decreases the solubility. Sometimes both contributions cancel out and so called ideal solubility is observed. But the saturated solutions are pseudoideal only: excess Gibbs' energy is very small but excess enthalpy and excess entropy can be large. The thermodynamic properties of systems conforming to Schr\u00f6der or Malesi\u0144ski ideal solubility equations are discussed in detail. The test of thermodynamic cosistency of solubility data is formulated.",

            "abstract": "Professor Maciej Wiewi\u00f3rowski is one of the most distinguished organic chemists in the world. He got his PhD in 1950 working on the chemical transformations of codeine with Professor J. Suszko at Pozna\u0144 University. Next, he started developing his own research programme concerning the alkaloid composition of certain Lupinus species. Several of his students then are still continuing the structural and synthetic research in this topic.\nAt the end of the fifties, he spent quite some time on his first long-term post-doctoral fellowship working with Professor Leo Marion in the laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa, and it appeared to be the beginning of his fruitful collaborations with many outstanding scientists in the world in the subsequent years. When working in this foreign laboratory, he took the opportunity to become acquainted with many modern research techniques, especially column chromatography and IR as well as other spectroscopic methods, which enabled him to propagate and popularize these techniques in our country when he returned.\nIn the late sixties, being the Head of the Stereochemistry and Organic Spectrochemistry Division at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144, he began to organize, under the auspices of the Polish Academy of Science, a&nbsp;new field of research in Poland, then undeveloped worldwide, concerning the synthesis of nucleic acids. He both gathered young scientists, giving them special training, and organized new laboratories outside the University. In the early seventies, he moved with his group to the tentative laboratories at Noskowskiego Street in Pozna\u0144, there systematically and intensively expanding this research center, which finally resulted in the creation of the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the PASc, a&nbsp;leader in the scientific world in carrying out modern biochemical research in nucleic acid as well as in protein chemistry.\nDuring recent years, already being retired, he is still very active in the life of the Institute , including carrying out research mainly on the reaction of nucleosides in a&nbsp;solid state.",

            "abstract": "Molecules of solute in the liquid phase can display partial orientation owing to the interaction of an anisotropic magnetic susceptibility tensor with an external magnetic field or/and to the interaction with anisotropic liquid crystal solvent. In the latter case orientation of the solvent molecules is caused by the magnetic field as well. Formal, statistic description of the solute molecular orientation is identical in both cases and it has been demonstrated without recalling to the Wigner rotation matrices. Since the orientation of solute molecules is not averaged out due to the rotational diffusion completely, several interactions, additional to the isotropic liquid phase, manifest in the NMR spectra, namely, dipolar nad quadrupolar interactions as well as anisotropic parts of chemical shifts (screening) and spin-spin couplings. Therefore, a&nbsp;number of structural molecular parameters, which depend on those interactions, become accessible. Determination of very accurate geometries of small organic molecules and the accuracy improvement of the NMR-derived structures of biomolecules are the most frequent applications of the NMR studies in anisotropic phases. Analysis of the NMR spectra of 3,5-dichlorphenylacethylene in the nematic solvent ZLI1169 has been presented as an example of the liquid crystal solvent application.",

One peculiar property of urea is its ability to form hydrogen bonds with many organic and inorganic compounds, where it can play the role of both a&nbsp;proton donor and a&nbsp;proton acceptor. The hydrogen bonds present in urea complexes are revealed by some characteristic points in equilibria curves, especially in the liquidus curves and also in the courses of some physical property curves like viscosity, refractive index or dielectric constant versus composition of a&nbsp;binary mixture. Hydrogen-bonded complexes can be practically applied to purify and to separate organic substances that are able to form hydrogen bonds or to remove contaminants that have such properties. The main advantage of processes based on hydrogen bond formation is that the complexes formed can be easily cleaved e.g. by addition of water or by increasing the temperature whereupon complexant is recycled. The structure and the physical properties of urea complexes with water, hydrogen peroxide, phenol, cresols, dihydroxybenzenes, naphthols and tetrabutylammonium acetate are reviewed. Physical properties of urea single crystals are also mentioned which can be applied in non-linear optics. The literature data on urea behaviour in complexed systems both calculated theoretically and determined experimentally are collected and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Organic peroxides are an interesting group of organic compounds. The O-O bonds in their structure warrant their properties determining the range of their application. The chemistry of peroxy substances is a&nbsp;branch of knowledge which is continuously developing. In the course of recent years much progress has been achieved both in the field of synthesizing new peroxides systems and in applaying them, particularly concerning their biological transformations.\nA peroxide bond displays a&nbsp;low dissociation energy (20-50 kcal/mol) and that is why they are rather unstable. The reactions of peroxy substances may be divided into homolytic (radical) and heterolytic (ionic) ones. The most popular reaction of the monomolecular homolytic decomposition of the peroxide bond into radicals, occuring under the influence of temperature or radiation, is typical for all classes of peroxy substances and has found practical application. Theretically possible is also a&nbsp;molecular heterolytic decomposition of the peroxide bond into ions. Such a&nbsp;decomposition cannot compete, however, with the homolitic one and is required only in few specific cases. The O-O bond can also undergo transfomations in result of reactions with other substances. Also these reactions may be divided into two fundamental types. Some peroxy substances, e.g. hydroperoxides and peroxy acids, are electron donors and may occur in the reactions as nucleophiles. On the other hand, peroxy substances display the properties of \"soft electrophiles\" reacting with nucleophilic reagents. The result of such a&nbsp;reaction is a&nbsp;heterolytic decomposition of the peroxide bond. This ambivalent feature of peroxy substances becomes most visible in the natural process of peroxy acids in a&nbsp;basic medium, in which the RCO3- ion plays the role of a&nbsp;nucleophile attacking the non ionized particle (the electrophile).\nIn recent years it has been more and more often stipulated that the reactions of peroxides with nucleophiles run in compliance with the mechanism of the electron transfer (SET) from the nucleophile particle to the oxygen atom of the peroxy bond, in the result of which radicals and radical ions are formed in the course of this reaction. It ought to be stressed that it is extremely difficult to determine the mechanisms of many reactions of peroxy substances explicitly, becouse these types of reactions (SN2, SET) may take place simultaneously and in most cases lesd to the formation of some products.",

Although first bisphosphonates were synthesized in the middle of XIX century, the concept of their use as inhibitors of bone resorption appeared in 1968. One group of biologically active bisphosphonates, which included the earliest bisphosphonates, constituted methylenebisphosphonates bearing simple 1-alkyl; 1,1-dihalo, 1-thiophenyl and/or 1-hydroxy substituents at the P-C-P grouping with a&nbsp;specific affinity to the bone tissue (etidronate, clodronate, tiludronate). The ability of bisphosphonates to bind to crystals of hydroxyapatites and to prevent both crystal growth and dissolution was enhanced when 1-chlorine atom (as in clodronate) was replaced by 1-hydroxyl group (as in etidronate). Newer bisphosphonates having a&nbsp;basic primary nitrogen atom in an alkyl chain (as in pamidronate and alendronate) and the recent ones containing a&nbsp;tertiary nitrogen (as in ibandronate and olpadronate) or a&nbsp;nitrogen atom within the heterocyclic ring (as in risedronate and zoledronate) are much more potent anti-resorptive compounds. The potency to inhibit bone resorption in rats increases from 1 to 10 000 in the sequence etidronate In this review historically first syntheses of bisphosphonates described by Menschutkin (1865) and von Bayer-Hofmann (1898) as well as representative syntheses of clodronate, tiludronate, pamidronate, alendronate and risedronate are presented.",

            "abstract": "Oxidation reactions are fundamental processes widely applied in organic synthesis. Among many reagents used in these reactions, elemental selenium and particularly some of its compounds have been reported as effective and selective oxidants and catalysts for the oxidation of various organic substrates [5, 6, 10, 37]. One of them is selenium(IV) oxide, easily available regent for hydroxylation of activated a-positions particularly at allylic and propargylic sites. It also can introduce carbonyl functionality at activated positions. Used in combination with hydrogen peroxide or t-butylhydroperoxide it acts as oxygen-transfer agent. Both of these hydroperoxides can be used in the presence of seleniumu(IV) oxide for epoxidation, 1,2-dihydroxylation and a-carbonylation of alkenes, for oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, sulfides to sulfoxides or sulfones, secondary amines to nitrones and for other reactions [5-10, 22, 23, 36, 37, 47, 48, 61, 71, 89, 91,92].\nBenzeneseleninic acid, other areneseleninic acids and their anhydrides are known as stoichiometric oxidants or activators of other oxygen donors. They have been successfully applied for oxidation of many organic compouns, among them alkenes, alcohols, phenols, amines, hydrazones, sulfides, 1,3-dithiolanes and azines [5, 10, 105, 107, 120, 129, 133, 144].\nOrganic diselenides, the precursors of seleninic acids, have been used as oxygen-transfer catalysts for oxidation of various functional groups with hydrogen peroxide, t-butylhydroperoxide and other oxygen donors [152-154, 163-165, 168-174] while dimethyl and diphenyl selenoxides are efficient stoichiometric oxidants (e.g. for conversion of halomethyl or hydroxymethyl group into formyl group) [177-189].\nMost recently, selenenamides, particularly 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen) and its analogous were found as efficient catalysts for hydrogen peroxide and tbutylhydroperoxide oxofunctionalization of olefins, oxidation of azomethine compounds and sulfides [163, 165, 202].",

            "abstract": "Migraine is a&nbsp;common, chronic disorder affecting the lives of millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a&nbsp;throbbing headache, which is usualy unilateral, and is often associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. The precise mechanisms underlying the cause of migraine are still unclear and several theories regarding its etiology have been proposed. The vasodilatory theory of migraine suggested that extracranial arterial dilatation during an attack was related to migraine pain; the neurological theory propossed that migraine resulted from abnormal firing in brain neurons. The neorogenic dural inflammation theory supposed thet the dural membrane surrounding the brain become inflammed and hypersensitive due to release of neuropeptides from primary sensory nerve terminals. Substantia P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nitric oxide are all thought to play a&nbsp;role in the dural inflammation cascade.\nSeveral clinical and experimental observations confirm that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has an important role in producing or maintaining migraine attack. The serotonin connection with migraine is additionally supported by the efficacy of serotonin receptor ligands. Sumatriptan - designed to interact with the specific type of serotonin receptors - was the first drug marketed worldwide for acute treatment of migraine. It activates 5-HT1B/1Dserotonin receptors on nerves and blood vessels and in so doing turns off inflammation and shrinks swollen blood vessels, believed to contribute to migraine pain.\nThe introduction and the success of sumatriptan initiated an intense search for improved triptamide derivatives. New medications are being released in rapid sequence. Today four second-generation triptans are on the market: zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and almotriptan and two others (eletriptan and frovatriptan) are about to be marketed.\nAll of the triptans share a&nbsp;common mode of action, but the new ones are more lipophilic and have higher oral bioavailability than sumatriptan. Adverse events for triptans include: tightening, flushing and paraesthesias of unknown case. All of them cause narrowing of arteries, including coronary arteries, and although serious adverse vascular events are very rare, triptan use is contraindicated in patients with vascular disease.\nFinally, a&nbsp;problem with the triptans is a&nbsp;recurrence of headache a&nbsp;few hours after initial successful treatment. Because clinical-trial data suggest that the differences among the various triptans are subtle rather than dramatic, it is not yet clearly established whether these new agents represent a&nbsp;major improvement over sumatriptan in therapeutic effectiveness.\nDespite an indisputable progress in migraine therapy triptans have not yet provided an optimal answer and future work in this field is still warranted. Recently, a&nbsp;novel arylpiperazine derivative of serotonin with potent, selective and unique high intrisic activity at 5-HT1B/1D receptors (F 11356) is developed to be superior over the representatives of triptans family.\nApart from the 5-HT1B/1D agonists several other classes of ligands have been suggested as potentially beneficial in acute treatment of migraine, namely 5-HT1F agonists and 5-HT2H antagonist.\nThese new directions as well as a&nbsp;review of a&nbsp;currently available antimigraine drugs from the family of 5-HT receptor ligands are summarized in this article.",

            "abstract": "This review attempts to briefly summarise the recent developments in the study of new compounds improving learning, memory and cognitive function. a&nbsp;large number of compounds belonging to many different chemical classes have been proposed as cognition enhancers. Three groups of compounds - nootropics, cholinergic drugs and neuromodulators are presented [3].\nMost compounds described as nootrpics are 2-pyrrolidone derivatives, the prototype of which is piracetam (Nootropil) [4-6]. Nootropics facilitate learning and memory in animal models [5-25]. Clinical trials have yielded unconvincing results, however some new drugs such as nefiracetam [9, 10] and fasoracetam [20-22] appear promising.\nCentral cholinergic systems have been repeatedly shown to play an important role in learning and memory. The deficits in cognitive and memory performance observed in aged humans and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are due at least in part to deficient cholinergic functioning[26-29]. Augmentation of cholinergic neurotransmission might be accomplished in several different ways [33-37]. Cholinergic agonists directly acting on muscarinic receptors may improve the defective cholinergic function seen in AD [36]. Selective second-generation muscarinic agonists appear promising and are in various stages of preclinical and clinical evaluation, including milameline [41], itameline [42, 43], xanomeline [44, 45], sabcomeline [49, 50] and talsaclidine [51]. These compounds are chemically related to the naturally occurring muscarinic agonist, arecoline [33].\nThe prototypical neuronal acetylcholine receptors agonist nicotine has been shown to ameliorate some of the symptoms of AD, and, in a&nbsp;number of animal models, to have neuroprotective effects [52-54]. Some nicotinic agonists were reported to be active in animal models of memory and learning, such as compounds ABT-418, ABT-089 and SIB-1553A [55-57].\nAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is presently the most successful method to ameliorate cholinergic deficit and lead to symptomatic improvement. About 30 AChE inhibitors are currently being studied word-wide in preclinical or clinical studies [3, 33, 35, 37]. AChE inhibitors are broadly classified in three categories. These include: the carbamates such as physostigmine, eptastigmine [59], phenserine [58] and rivastigmine; the aminoacridines such as tacrine, velnacrine, suronacrine [35], and their derivatives ipidacrine [68] and compound SM-10888 ; the benzylpiperidines such as donepezil, T-82 [72], TAK-147 and CP-118954 [73-75]. Tacrine was the the first drug approved in 1993 in USA for treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type [66, 67]. Rivastigmine [63-65], and donepezil [69-71] were approved in 1997. Cymserine and bis-norcimserine are derivatives of the alkaloid physostigmine. These compounds represent the first available potent, reversible, and selective inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase [60-62]. The organophosphate metrifonate has been extensively studied in animals and recently evaluated in AD. Metrifonat is an inactive prodrug, but is non-enzymatically transformed into the active compound dichlorvos that irreversibly inhibits AChE [76, 77].\nThere are many reports on the interaction between the cholinergic system and other putative neurotransmitter on the central nervous system. Therefore, such transmitter interactions play an important role in the regulation of learning and memory. Modulators, the third group of compounds represents different structures. a&nbsp;wide variety of substances have been shown to facilitate memory, including: opioid agonist (SA 4503) [78, 79], a&nbsp;benzodiazepine inverse agonist (S-8510) [85, 86], modulator of noradrenergic transmission (CR 2249) [87]; derivatives of piperazine (FK-960 [80, 81], ensaculine [83]) and peptides (NC-1900) [88].",

            "abstract": "Insect antifeedants are chemicals which inhibit feeding, but do not kill the insect directly, the insect often remaining near the antifeedant source and possibly dying through starvation. Many antifeedants have been found in plants, being a&nbsp;part of their protective system against its predators.\nAntifeedants, unlike pesticides, are often selectively toxic towards some insect species, whereas they are not harmful to the other ones and to mammals. As crop protection currently relies upon the use of broad spectrum of pesticides, friendlier to environment antifeedants are focus of recent research. Their current use is limited, as it is difficult to obtain them in useful quantities. Moreover, most of them are highly complexed molecules, which are not readily synthesised. The aim of researchers is to obtain a&nbsp;synthetic antifeedant of a&nbsp;simple structure, which retain the potency of natural products and fulfil synthetic requirements to be of practical use.\nThe mono- and sesquiterpenoid natural and synthetic antifeedants are presented here. There are few natural monoterpenoid compounds of deterrent activity (fig. 3) [14-18], whereas there are many numerous groups of sesquiterpene ones. The most known among sesquiterpenes are drimanes (fig. 4), isolated from bark of Drimys species, containing bicyclofarnesane skeleton - active antifeedants against aphids [19,20]. The second large group are compounds isolated from mushrooms of Lactarius species, divided into marasmanes (fig. 9) and lactaranes (fig. 10, 11), active towards stored products pests [38-40].\nMany synthetic derivatives of natural antifeedants have been investigated so as to find correlation between structure and activity [27,39-42]. Biological data showed that there is no single functional group responsible for deterrent activity. Even a&nbsp;small structure modification in different parts of a&nbsp;molecule may reduce the activity drastically. However, it is significant, that en-dialdehyde function, as well as g- or d-lactone ring are often present in active feeding deterrents. Sesquiterpene lactones, isolated from wide range of plants, are a&nbsp;very large group of insect antifeedants (fig. 11, 13-19) [46-59].\nMono- and sesquiterpene lactones are the most promising compounds in search of new, synthetic insect antifeedants. Several synthetic terpenoid lactones of twelve carbon atoms, active deterrents against stored grain pests, are also presented (fig. 20) [60-64].",

            "abstract": "Antifeedants, chemicals which prevent insects from feeding, have been at the centre of interest of researchers for the last forty years. Most of them are of natural origin., being a&nbsp;part of plant protective system. Antifeedants of followin groups: diterpenoids (including degraded limonoids), triterpenoids, alkaloids, lignanes, flavonoids, and coumarine derivatives are presented here.\nThe most numerous group of diterpenoids are cleradanes, isolated mainly from plants of Teucrium genus [17]. Clerodin (fig. 2) [8-12], ajugarin (fig. 1) [1,2] and jodrellin (fig. 3) [18] are the best known members of this group. The second large group are limonoids, belonging to tetranortriterpenes, found mainly in plants of Meliaceae and Rutaceae family. The main compound of this group is azadirachtin (fig. 10), isolated from Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) [36, 58]. Not being harmful to mammals, it displays strong feedingdeterrent activity towards a&nbsp;great number of insect species. Huge amount of limonoids has beeb found in plants (figs 11-13, 15) [60-69]. Advanced studies on the synthesis and correlation between chemical structures and biological activity for clerodanes [3-7, 11, 12, 19-25] and limonoids [48-58' 70-74] have been carried out. Synthetic fragments of natural antifeedants, which exhibit activity comparable to the natural compounds, are also presented (figs 1, 3, 10) [3-5, 19, 48].\nDegraded limonoids are the natural and synthetic diterpenoid compounds, the structures of which are fragments of natural limonoids (figs 16-19). Great interes has been taken in this group for the last 10 years [76-90].\nSome alkaloids are also presented here (figs 20-22), as they are one of the first known insect antifeedants [92-96]. They are active towards different insect species [97-103], including stored grain pests [91]. Feeding deterrents of lignanes [105, 106] and flavonoids [107] are shown on fig. 24. The last presented group are coumarine derivatives (fig. 25), active against Spodoptera litura [108, 109]. In this case studies on structure-activity correlation were carried out as well (fig. 26 - the most active synthetic coumarine antifeedans).\nThe perception of antifeedants at the sensory level may involve different mechanisms [44]. Feeding deterrents may stimulate specialized receptors tuned to other compounds and thus alter the sensory code. There is also a&nbsp;hypothesis, based on electrophysiological data, that the impulses from different receptors are not received independently, but in a&nbsp;comlexed form. Modification of this neural code changes insect's behaviour.\nOn the basis of biological data it has been postulated that polyphagous insets are less sensitive to antifeedants than more specialised species [116-118].",

In order to find the answer for the following question: what kind of stoichiometry, geometry and binding mode there is in complexes which arrive in studied ternary systems? We used different methods: pH-metric method and spectroscopic ones (UV-VIS, EPR and NMR).\nThe results obtained in our investigations and presented in this text show that the steric effect plays a&nbsp;very important role in the formation of the mixed-ligand complexes. In the case of bulky polyamine bonded in the zink(II) equimolar complex the coordination of a- or b-alaninehydroxamic acid is more favoured than the second polyamine ligand. There is no mixed-ligand complex formation in the case of ternary sestems with nickel(II). The reason for this is in the geometry of parent complexes - octahedral for nickel(II)-amine and square planar for nickel(II)-a-Alaha systems. The tridentate coordination of diethylenetriamine results in five-coordinated mixed-ligand copper(II) complexes in which the aminohydroxamate moiety adopts an equatorial-axial coordination mode.",

            "abstract": "Lithium batteries of various types have found use in portable electronic devices and are also considered for application in electric or hybrid vehicles because of their high operating voltage and energy density [1-26]. Among a&nbsp;number of materials examined as the positive electrode in lithium batteries with organic electrolyte solution, much attention has been paid to transition metal oxides, in particular to manganese dioxide and its lithiated derivatives. Electrochemical studies have proved that these compounds are able to accommodate or remove Li+ ions in parallel with the electron injection or extraction thus changing the oxidation state of manganese (IV/III) upon the solid state redox reaction [27-37]. \tThe capacity and power density of intercalation electrodes varies with the crystallographic and electronic structure of their solid phase [22, 34, 54-67], electrode thickness and porosity as well as the chemical nature and conductivity of the electrolyte solution [68-74]. The kinetics of the electrochemical intercalation-deintercalation of Li+ ions is mostly limited by the diffusion of these ions into or from the host matrix. Another limitation comes from an electrolyte depletion in pores of the electrode material during the discharge, as the rate of the Li+ ions transport from the bulk electrolyte is lower in comparison with the charge transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The diffusion model for nonporous and porous intercalation electrodes [68, 69, 74] quite well describes the surface and bulk distribution of Li+ ions in the solid phase as well as in the pore electrolyte, as a&nbsp;function of the discharge rate and discharge degree (Fig. 1 to Fig. 4). The experimental characteristics of MnO2 and compounds of the Li-Mn-O system, obtained at various electrode thickness, particle size and charge-discharge density has confirmed the theoretical predictions (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11) [49, 73, 85, 108-112, 137, 138, 162, 230, 302, 379].\nManganese dioxide (g-MnO2) electrodes having discharge capacity of 220-270 Ah/kg at E\u00bb3 V vs. Li/Li+ (Fig. 6) [62, 79, 94-103, 106, 107] show a&nbsp;limited rechargeability on charge-discharge cycling in secondary lithium cells (Fig. 5) [65, 85, 88, 102-104, 113-119]. As evidenced by XRD-ray patterns this is due to anisotropic expansion and contraction of the crystallographic unit cell at the average manganese valence of about +3.5 [62-64, 79, 88, 103, 105]. a&nbsp;significantly higher cycling efficiency can be achieved with MnO2(CDMO) [121-129] and Li-Mn-O spinel phases (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) [49, 64, 131-192], providing a&nbsp;three-dimensional interstitial space for Li+ ions transport. The cubic close-packed structure of the stoichiometric LiMn2O4 remains almost unchanged upon deintercalation to l-MnO2 and subsequent reintercalation to x \u00bb 1 in the potential range E \u00bb 4 V (vs. Li/Li+). One can obtain the rechargeable capacity of 125 Ah/kg at moderate current rates [49, 64, 131, 144, 147, 149, 193-195] owing to the relatively fast solid state diffusion of Li+ ions for 0\u00bb 3 V and E \u00bb 1 V (Fig. 7) correspond to the intercalation degree of 1E-x) curves at makes the basis for spinel electrodes application in energy storage devices.\nIn the last years, several overlithiated and defect spinel phases of the general formula Li1+xMn2-xO4 (0 \u0141 x \u0141 0,33), Li1-xMn2-2xO4 (0 \u0141 x \u0141 0,11) or Li1+xMn2-xO4-y (0 \u0141 x \u0141 0,33) [122, 144, 166, 177, 196, 216-219] have been used in the so-called \"lithium-ion\" batteries with the carbon based negative electrode [304-351]. Alternative lihium-ion batteries contain two transition metal oxides having different intercalation potentials [352-360]. Quite recently, a&nbsp;family of mixed spinel oxides Li[M(1+x)/2Mn(3-x)/2]O4 (-1 \u0141 x \u0141 1; M = Co, Cu, Fe, Co, Cr) has been proposed for the positive electrode [365-377], Li[Li0,33Ti1,67]O4 as the negative electrode [354-360]. Future improvement of the charge-discharge performance of spinel electrodes for primary and secondary lithium batteries can be expected under a&nbsp;complex optimisation of the synthesis methods, the electrode mophology, porosity and thickness. Furthermore, the advanced batteries require the high conductivity electrolyte-solvent systems, stable in the potential range of at least 0 to 5V.",

            "abstract": "The earliest explosive mixtures containing aluminium powder were patented at the beginning of the 20th century. Since then, aluminium has been used in lots of successively worked up explosives designed both for commercial and military applications. It is considered that aluminium powder is an energising and sensitizing component. Howewer, the behaviour of aluminium in detonation is not well understood despite the long history of it use in explosives. Depending on dominant theories in related sciences, researchers have proposed different hypothesis describing participation of aluminium in chemical reactions in detonation waves.\nIn this work, some published data concerning the influence of aluminium additive on detonation velocity and composition of solid detonation products are analysed. According to classification of aluminised explosives proposed in Ref. [5], we divided the mixtures examined into high explosives sensitised composite explosives (CX-Al-1) and mixtures including crystalline oxidisers that have only slightly marked explosive properties (CX-Al-2). For instant, some results of detonation velocity maesurements for the first group are presented in Figs 1(4 and in Tables 1 and 2. They show the influence of amount of aluminium and its finenes on detonation velocity of composite explosives containing RDX, HMX, TNT or PETN. The composition of solid detonation products of CX-Al-1 explosives was the subject of researches in Ref. [18(25] and their results were the base for estimation of the degree of aluminium oxidation in detonations, Ref. [20, 22, 25]. Some of results are also analysed in this work. Figs 7 and 8 as well as Table 4 contain values of detonation velocity for explosive from the second group - CX-Al-2. The explosives included ammonium nitrate, guanidine nitrate or ammonium perchlorate as oxidisers.\nOn the base of the overview, a&nbsp;hypothetical mechanism of detonation of aluminised composite explosives is proposed. In our opinion, the effectiveness of aluminium oxidation is affected by properties of the main ingredient of an explosive.",

            "abstract": "In the search for new anticonvulsants, derivatives of a-substituted g-amino-, g-phthalimido-, and g-hydroxybutyric acid such as acids, esters and amides were obtained [24, 25, 28, 29, 33]. Preliminary pharmacological tests, a&nbsp;maximal electroshock (MES) and a&nbsp;subcutaneous metrazole (scMet), and a&nbsp;rotorod toxicity assay for all synthesized compounds were employed [34, 35]. It was shown that a-substituted N-benzylamides of g-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) were the most potent compounds and possessed anticonvulsant activities in the (MES) screens [24, 29, 33]. The most potent anticonvulsant compounds were a-(benzylamino)- g-hydroxybutyric acid N-benzylamide (39) and N-(2-chlorobenzylamide) (40) with medium effective (ED50) doses 63.0 mg/kg and 54.0 mg/kg, respectively [29]. These compounds were less active then the commonly used anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, but had higher activity in the MES screen than sodium valproate. The preliminary biochemical tests suggest that the active amides are acted as an allosteric modulator of the g-aminobutyric acid, GABA-A complex, and have the affinity to voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) receptors. It may be the possible mechanism which mediates the anticonvulsant effect of these compounds [28, 29]. \tFour series of N-benzylamides of GHB, which contained the N-(4-phenylpiperazine)- (series A), N-(4-benzylpiperazine)- (series B), N-benzylamino-(series C), or N-(2-phenylethylamine)- (series D), group in the a-position of GHB were selected as models to found out the structural elements and/or physicochemical properties responsible for their anticonvulsant action. The lipophilicities of four anticonvulsant active series of compounds were determined by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (RM value) [51, 52]. The partition coefficients (log P) of the amides were calculated by use of the Prolog P module of the Pallas system [53]. Comparison of RM and log P enabled calculation of clog P values. It was found that anticonvulsant activity of amides series A-D may be explained on the basis of their lipophilicity. In order to point to some structural features correlating with the MES anticonvulsant activity crystal structure analysis followed by conformational analysis was carried out on two compounds (21 and 29) of series a&nbsp;and B [33]. Molecular modelling investigations were carried out using computer program [66] on the representative compounds of series A-D. Based on the pharmacological, physicochemical, rentgenostructural and molecular modelling results the pharmacophore model for anticonvulsant N-substituted amides of GHB was design. In this model, the presence of the N-benzylamide fragment is essential for activity. For amides the further elements are hydrophobic unit (aryl ring) as a&nbsp;distal binding site and H-bond as a&nbsp;donor function. Based on this model new compounds with expected anticonvulsant activity may be design.",

            "abstract": "The design of optoelectronic components with molecular dimensions is an area of active research and theoretical calculations. Unsaturated organic molecules containing p-conjugated bonds have been explored in connection with \"molecular wires\", transfer of electrons across lipid membranes, molecular mimicry of photosynthetic energy and electron transfer.\nIn this paper we report the most recent achievements related to synthesis and properties (i.e., spectroscopic data, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and electron transfer processes, thermal stability) as well as potential applications of well defined oligomeric conjugated structures derived from oligomers of acetylene; in the literature they are named conjugated polyenes. These compounds are characterized by the presence of polar end groups: the donor (D - e.g., derived from anilines, thiophenes, ferrocenes, 1,4-dithiafulvenes, julolidine moiety) with electron donating capabilities and the acceptor (A - e.g., nitro, formyl, dicyanomethylen, derived from thiobarbituric acid) able to withdraw electrons (Fig. 1, Table 1). The D and a&nbsp;groups are connected through a&nbsp;conjugated p - system (e.g., polyenic, polyaromatic or polyheteroaromatic chain). Unsymmetrical substitution of the polyene chain defines a&nbsp;class of push-pull polyenes and symmetrical one creates push - push or pull - pull entities. Their structural properties are the results of a&nbsp;subtle balance between different factors, among which of particular importance are the chain length and the donor acceptor strength (Fig. 2.).\nThe synthesis of polyene chains has been widely explored in literature. The most commonly employed procedure for the synthesis of conjugated spacers involves a&nbsp;sequence of Wittig-type reactions (Fig. 3, Table 2). The alternative, iterative building block method applies oligosililoxy ethers and tempaltes (e.g. 5,5-dietoxypenta-2-enal) to involve the polyene chain increase (Fig. 4.).\nAccording to the literature all conjugated polyenes reveal satisfactorily high decomposition temperatures (above 230 <sup>o</sup>C) which makes them good candidates for optoelectronic devices (Tables 3 and 4).\nThe conjugated polyenes are of particular interest as model systems of one dimensional conjugated chromophores. It is now generally recognized that bipolaronic charge states dominate in most oxidatively doped p-electron conjugated structures with non-degenerate ground states (Fig.6). In general, all such molecules undergo a&nbsp;Peierls distortion, making charge transport between chain ends dependent upon thermal processes and limiting the rate of such charge transport. The use of solitonic moieties as charge carriers in molecular wires is among the initial proposals for molecular electronics (Fig. 7.). Solitons have also been suggested for use in molecular gates or switches (Fig. 8.).\nThe UV-VIS spectra of the D-p-A system in solution display a&nbsp;low energy absorption band, which is attributed to the ICT from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the efficiency of such a&nbsp;process modulates the physical properties of the system. Some examples are collected in Tables 5, 6 and 7.",

The presented iteration model is probably the simplest algorithm which allows to describe both multienzymatic and multisubstate reactions giving concentration evolution of all participants in the investigated system. Action of various kinds of inhibition, enzyme inactivation, reverse reaction, single and multiple chain reactions can be accurately simulated. This method can be applied to obtain a&nbsp;product with desired properties. In addition, the model can be used to predict hydrolysis patterns of starch by different amylases, too.\nTo check the validity of the model against the experimental data the process of starch hydrolysis by mixture of three amylolytic enzymes has been simulated and the results presented. Agreement between simulated and experimental data through the course of the reaction was excellent in all the reaction stages.",

            "abstract": "Aminosugars widely exist as a&nbsp;part of biologically important natural products. They are found in some antibiotics, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, glycolipides, glycoproteins and blood group determinants [1-5]. Most wide-spread aminosugars are 2-amino-2-deoxyaldoses and among them D-glucosamine. Because of its abundance of occurrence and function fulfilled, this aminosugar is often used in the synthesis of glycosides, as well as a&nbsp;glycosyl donor or acceptor. The methods of synthesis of glycosides have been well known for many years. The classical Koenigs-Knorr method is one of the oldest methods for the preparation of glycosides and requires glycosyl halides as donors (most often bromide or chloride) and heavy metal salts (mainly mercury and silver) as a&nbsp;promoter [6]. The alternative procedure is the imidate method, which requires the use of 1-O-trichloroacetimidate derivative of sugar as glycosyl donor and BF3 \u00b7 Et2O or trimethylsilyl triflate as promoter [7]. Apart from these two ways, others should be mentioned, namely: the orthoester and thioglycoside method, those methods using of glycals, 1,2-anhydrosugars and pent-4-enyl glycosides [8-11]. However, these methods have been known for many years ( and still modified ( the selective synthesis of glycosides still determines the main challenge in the chemistry of carbohydrates. The course of reaction, its stereoselectivity, speed and yield depend on many factors, the most important of which seem to be: the leaving group at the anomeric carbon atom in donors, the conditioners of the reaction ( solvent, temperature, promoter and a&nbsp;character of the protecting groups at almost all carbon atoms ( especially at carbon C-2, as this group can constitute part of the so-called participating group in the process of creation of the glycoside bond. Description of the glycosylation mechanism can be found in many papers [6-13].\nSeveral new amino protecting groups have been described recently, particularly for the (NH2 function in D-glucosamine. Choice of the 2-amino protecting group is very important and will have a&nbsp;strong influence on the synthesis of the desired glycosides. In this paper we would like to describe the most popular protecting groups. They belong to different group-types, among which we can find: (i) amides ( acetyl (NHAc) [4], trifluoroacetyl (NHTFAc) [14-20], diacetyl (NdiAc) [21, 22], pent-4-enoyl (NHPent) [23-25]; (ii) imines ( p-methoxybenzylidene (NBzlOMe) [26-31]; (iii) carbamates ( allyloxycarbonyl (NHAloc) [32-34], 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (NHTroc) [35-41] and other alkoxycarbonyl (NHAlkoc) [33]; (iv) cyclic imides ( phthaloyl (NPhth) [42-54], 4-nitrophthaloyl (NNP) [55-57], 4,5-dichlorophthaloyl (NDCP) [58, 59], tetrachlorophthaloyl (NTCP) [22, 25, 60-66], diphenylmaleyl (NDPhM) [67], thiodiglycoloyl (NTDG) [68] and dithiasuccinoyl (NDts) [69, 70], which are exemplified below (Figure 1).",

The main mechanisms of the processes which are induced both by nonionic polymers and polyelectrolytes as well as adsorbing and nonadsorbing macromolecules, are briefly reviewed in this paper.\nIn the majority of systems in which stabilization/flocculation processes were studied, the colloidal particles were large, compared with the radii of gyration of macromolecules. On the other hand, it was found that interactions between very small colloidal particles and large polymer molecules are important in such areas like the water and waste water purification [46-47] and paper manufacture [48]. They also play a&nbsp;major role in biological systems [49-51]. The systems composed of very small particles and large macromolecules have been found to reveal a&nbsp;number of original features [29-30,102].\nThe relative size of macromolecules and particles has a&nbsp;significant effect on the conformation of the polymer adsorbed [43,62-84], the interparticle interaction [45] and the structure of aggregates formed [28-29,74,102]. When colloidal particles are smaller than the macromolecules then a&nbsp;single particle accommodates only a&nbsp;part of the polymer chain, the rest of the molecule extends far away from the particle as a&nbsp;long end which can adsorb on the free surface of other particles [43,72-76,83-84]. Multiplets composed of a&nbsp;number of particles attached to a&nbsp;single polymer molecule are formed [28-29,37,51,72,84-90,102]. Properties of these multiplets determine the phase behavior of the system; if further association takes place the macroscopic phase separation is observed, otherwise the suspension is stable [37,85-86,89,102]. Primarily, the interactions between the multiplets depend on their structures which, in turn, are determined by numerous factors like the polymer-to-particle number concentration, adsorption affinity, particle interactions, architecture and conformations of polymer molecules, and others.\nA number of models of the adsorption of large macromolecules on very small colloidal particles [71-79] and the flocculation and stabilization processes of fine suspensions by high-molecular-weight polymers [94-97] were proposed.\nThe mode of action of very long polymer chains on fine suspensions was studied with computer simulations [91-93]. The floc structures and formation kinetics were investigated as a&nbsp;function of polymer/particle concentration ratio and the chain conformation.",

            "abstract": "In a&nbsp;short introduction the importance of hydrogen bonding is emphasized in life sciences and its role in molecular recognition and creation of living molecular systems. Then an attempt to define this specific molecular interaction is undertaken. Among most important features one should distinguish a&nbsp;particular repulsion potential which enables to approach directly interacting atoms on a&nbsp;distance markedly less than the sum of van der Waals radii. An important feature of hydrogen bonds is also the appearance of a&nbsp;double minimum potential for the proton motion. Among the main physical properties of hydrogen bonds there are analyzed dipole moments, nuclear magnetic resonance, quadrupole magnetic resonance, infra-red spectra and isotope effects. Most important isotope effects are related to infra-red spectra, geometry of bridges, phase transitions in hydrogen bonded ferroelectrics and fractionation factor. The evolution of the main characteristics is discussed depending on the acid-base properties expressed by means of the DpKa value of interacting components. a&nbsp;separate chapter is devoted to a&nbsp;dualistic nature of the interaction i.e. the structure creating and dynamical ones. The structure creating character is shown taking into account the induction of liquid crystalline properties while the dynamical properties are examplified on enzymic and photobiological processes and phase transitions in hydrogen bonded crystals. Current aspects of hydrogen bond interaction are limited to photoinduced proton transfer processes, the time resolved infra-red spectroscopy, low barrier hydrogen bonds (LBHB) and quantum molecular dynamics. In final remarks the importance of hydrogen bonding in searching for new materials of practical importance and crystal design are underlined.",

            "abstract": "Computer modelling of catalytic effects of a&nbsp;series of the transition metals and their alloys on the process of dissociation of molecular hydrogen has been performed. The project was composed of three stages. First, the binding energy versus the internuclear distance has been calculated for a&nbsp;series of metal dimers and mixed dimers: Ni2, NiCu, Cu2, Ag2, AgPd, Pd2 Au2, Pt2, AuPt. It has been shown that the traditional methods of quantum chemistry: the ZINDO semiempirical methods and the Hartree-Fock methods do not work properly in the case of the transition metal dimers. In contrast with these methods, the calculations based on the nonlocal version of the density functional theory (DFT) provide very good results, in full agreement with available experimental data concerning the dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths of the metal dimers.\nThen, using the fitted Morse form of the potential interaction between the metal atoms, the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed in order to obtain the atomic structures appearing in the alloys.\nThe third part of the project includes the quantum-chemical calculations of hydrogen atom and hydrogen molecule positioned over the metallic dimers. The interatomic distances of the dimers were taken from the MD calculations. a&nbsp;range of the distances of hydrogen from the metal dimers was scanned. The evolution of energy and electron density with the hydrogen distance from certain dimers, like NiCu, AgPd and Pd2, clearly exhibits the process of the hydrogen molecule dissociation. On a&nbsp;basis of these calculations a&nbsp;measure of catalytic power of the metals was defined and the series of metals and alloys was ordered according to their catalytic power. It was found that the highest catalytic power with respect to the hydrogen dissociation process is exhibited by NiCu alloys.\nAll the quantum-chemical calculations have been performed using the methods of the Density Functional Theory. The nonlocal version of the DFT was applied with the gradient-corrected hybrid functionals for electron exchange and correlation. The GAUSSIAN 98 suite of programs was employed in the calculations.",

            "abstract": "The present short review describes methods of preparation and synthetic applications of alkoxyallenes. The title compounds can be obtain by variety of methods based on elimination, substitution, addition, isomerization and alkylation reactions. Methods based on elimination reactions (Schemes 1-2) [4, 5] and on substitution of halogen (Scheme 3) [1], or alkoxy substituent (Schemes 4-5) [7-9] in allenes, or propargyl derivatives are not of great importance. The most important method of preparation of alkoxyallenes is based on isomerisation of propargyl ethers (Schemes 9-11) [15, 16, 18]. The rearrangement triple bond/allene offers possibility of introduction of alkyl or silyl substiuents by consecutive deprotonation-alkylation and/or silylation steps (Schemes 12-16) [20, 21, 24, 26].\nAlkoxyallenes undergo readily deprotonation a&nbsp;to the alkoxy group by treatment with n-butyl lithium [19]. The resulting lithium salt reacts with electrophiles such as carbonyl compounds (Schemes 12, 20, 22) [19] and alkyl halides (Scheme 14) [22] to afford substituted alkoxyallenes. Subsequent hydrolysis of alkoxyallene fragment provides a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Schemes 33, 34) [19, 54-56]. 1-Alkoxy-1-hydroxyalkylallenes in the presence of strong bases gave alkoxydihydrofurans or tetrahydrofuranones (Scheme 35) [57-59]. Alkoxyallenes subjected to [4+2]-, [2+2]-, and (1,3)-dipolar cycloaddition afford variety of heterocyclic compounds (Schemes 36-40, 43-48) [26, 61-66, 75-77]. Five- and six-membered heterocycles having exo-double bond may undergo rearrangements to form more stable compounds [75].\nAttractive chemical properties prompted many laboratories to use alkoxyallenes for the synthesis of natural products. Syntheses of (+)-goniodiol 58 (Scheme 23) [34], methylenomycin B 71 [39], erigerol 89 (Scheme 32) [53], (+)-allopumilitoxin 267 a&nbsp;91 (Scheme 33) [55], lacramin a&nbsp;158 (Fig. 3) [80], cytochalastin B 159 (Fig. 3) [81] and (\u00b1)-xanthocidin 162 (Fig. 3) [84] are the most representative.\nAlkoxyallenes undergo radical (Scheme 51) [89], cationic [90] and coordination (Scheme 53) [91, 92] polymerization providing polymers having exo-methylene groups. In certain cases, alkoxyallenes may undergo spontaneous polymerization [93] or polyaddition [94].",

            "abstract": "The main aim of the paper is to overview recent works dedicated to miscellaneous aspects of combustion process of metal- fluorocarbon polymer formulations. In order to systematise the collected data, the article is divided into sections discussing consecutively: mechanism of the combustion process and factors determining the linear burning rate, thermal decomposition of the mixtures, their sensitivity to mechanical, thermal and laser stimuli, emission characteristics of the flame accompanying combustion, problems concerning their stability and ageing process, and their application forms of military interest.\nMetal-fluorocarbon polymer compositions are heterogeneous high-energetic materials in which the burning rate is strongly dependent on the metal particle sizes (f) and the concentration of metal (x) in the mixture [8-16]. The oxidation reaction of metal particles is considered to occur from the surface of each particle and propagates towards its centre (Figs 1, 6). If the total burning surface area of the metal particles is small, the reaction completes at far downstream of the propellant burning surface. Therefore the heat flux feedback from the gas phase to the front of the combustion wave and, consequently, the burning rate rise when x increases and f decreases (Figs 2-5 and 7-9). By using metals that melt down at a&nbsp;temperature below the PTFE decomposition temperature (770 K), it is also possible to facilitate the initiation and propagation of the combustion wave in the compositions in question (Figs 5, 8, 9) [12, 13, 16].\nApplying different methods of thermal analysis to study the decomposition of PTFE in the presence of some metals, it has been shown that an addition of Mg, Al, Al3Mg4, Ti, B, Zr causes the purely endothermic decomposition of PTFE in nitrogen and argon to develop exotherms with onsets in the temperature range 740(770 K (Tab. 3, Figs 12, 13). As the amount of a&nbsp;metal increases these exotherms enlarge whereas the decomposition endotherm is reduced in size (Fig. 11).\nSize of Mg particles and its concentration in a&nbsp;MTV mixture affects not only the burning rate and decomposition parameters, but also the sensitivity of the mixture [11]. MTV compositions seem to be quite sensitive to impact and their sensitivity increases with increasing burning rate [21]. On the other hand, they have low sensitivity to friction (Tab. 5) [22] and do not produce a&nbsp;hazardous response while being heated under typical cookoff conditions (Tab. 6) [23].\nPTFE is an exceptionally good oxidiser in composition designed for producing high radiation output in the IR region (Tab. 7) [25, 26, 35, 36]. MTV compositions display functional relation between stoichiometry and specific intensity of radiation in 2-3-mm and 3-5-mm bands (Fig. 16). With rising weight fraction of Mg up to 60 % the specific intensity increases. For values of x>60 %, the radiation output decreases [26, 36]. Infrared tracking flares are the main direction of military applications of MTV formulations [4, 35, 36]. The latest patent in the field claims an IR-emitting flare composition comprising about 54(58 % of Mg and the remainder a&nbsp;mixture of PTFE and polytrifluorochloroethylene in substantially equal amount [36]. This mixture is superior to prior-art flares (Tab. 11, Fig. 21).\nAgeing of MTV is caused by the reaction of magnesium with water into magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. This reaction continues until all Mg is converted into Mg(OH)2 (Tab. 8, Fig. 17). The burning characteristics, the maximum pressure and in particular the burning time are changed with respect to unaged pellets (Fig. 18). These changes greatly affect the performance of the compositions [27].\nBecause of important advantages of MTV mixtures as a&nbsp;relative high caloric output, strong radiant output, generation of multiphase reaction products, low gas output, these compositions are used as igniters for solid rocket motors and other pyrotechnics. a&nbsp;general conclusion that can be made on the basis of the papers [27-33] is that metal rich compositions (containing 60(65 % Mg) perform better than other ones.\nFinally metal-PTFE formulations are a&nbsp;perfect solution for composite pyrotechnic mixtures in which presence of oxygen is undesirable. Such a&nbsp;situation takes place in compositions producing clouds rich in soot particles [37, 38] or in smoke-generating mixtures based on red phosphorus [39, 40].",

            "abstract": "Recently some interest has focused on compounds which - through interaction with both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors - may act as potential psychotropic agents [10]. Compounds with a&nbsp;dual activity at these receptor systems have been predicted to be more efficacious than those acting at only one of these systems. Some such compounds are arylpiperazine derivatives. This is the case with flibanserin and adatanserin, regarded as 5-HT1A agonists and 5-HT2A antagonists [11-13,16-22], which show an robust activity in a&nbsp;number of animal models of anxiety and depression [14-16,19,23]; at present they are studied in the clinic as potential anxiolytics/antidepressants [10]. Another arylopiperazine, ziprazidon, binds with a&nbsp;high affinity to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and D2 receptors [8,24]; being an antagonist at the latter receptors, it behaves like a&nbsp;5-HT1A agonist [25]. Ziprasidon is a&nbsp;novel antipsychotic drug [10].\nIn our own studies, a&nbsp;number of new arylpiperazines with high 5-HT1A / 5-HT2A [26-30] and D2 [30] affinity were obtained. In fact, 1-{3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl}-6-fluoroindolin-2(1H)-one (1) and 1-{3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl}-6-fluoroindolin-2(1H)-one (2) demonstrated a&nbsp;high 5-HT1A / 5-HT2A affinity and an in vivo antagonistic activity towards both the receptor subtypes, a&nbsp;phenomenon which is probably connected with the presence of a&nbsp;tree-membered spacer beetween terminal molecule fragments [26]. Also 1-{3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazynyl]propyl}-2,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (3) showed the same pharmacolo-gical profile of action. It has been suggested that the oxygen atom in position 2 in the amide fragment, as well as the 3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl fragment are a&nbsp;prerequisite for its pharmacological properties [27]. The new 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine derivative of 1,3-benzoxazolin-2,4-dione with n-butyl chain (4) may be qualified as a&nbsp;5-HT1A partial agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist; its 5-HT1A functional activity is likely to be connected with the character of the amide fragment, whereas the 1-arylphenyl fragment is important to the binding to both receptors [28]. The connection of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-b-carbolin-1-one moiety - through the 2-4 membered alkyl spacer - with 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazine permitted us to obtain compounds (5-7) with a&nbsp;high and an equal affinity for 5-HT1A / 5-HT2A receptors and with the expected functional properties, i.e. a&nbsp;distinct antagonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonistic one at 5-HT2A ones. These findings corroborate hypothesis that the presence of the 1-arylpiperazine fragment is crucial to the 5-HT1A / 5-HT2A affinity [29]. It has also been shown that 3-chloro (8) and 2-methoxy (9) derivatives of 1-[4-(4-aryl-1-piperazinyl]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)quinolinones are potent antagonists of 5-HT1A / 5-HT2A/D2 receptors and resemble some atypical antipsychotics [30].\nSumming up, some of the new investigated arylpiperazines may be considered as novel agents with psychotropic (i.e. anxiolytic/andidepressant/antipsychotic) properties.",

            "abstract": "Secondary metabolites of marine invertebrates continue to attract attention of organic chemists, biochemists, and pharmacologists due to their interesting structures and potent biological activities. One such example is cephalostatin 1 (Scheme 1) isolated from the Indian Ocean hemichordate Cephalodiscus gilchristi, which exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activity against a&nbsp;broad spectrum of malignant tumor cells [5]. Similar marine alkaloids (e.g. ritterazine G: Scheme 2) were found in the lipophilic extract of the tunicate Ritterella tokioka collected off the coast of Japan [7]. These very potent compounds, cephalostatins and ritterazines, belong to the large family of trisdecacyclic pyrazines consisting of two steroid units. The two steroid halves of cephalostatin 1 and other highly cytotoxic members of the family are different. The biological activity of the dimeric steroid-pyrazine marine alkaloids and their limited availability coupled with the new and intriguing structure make them an attractive challenge for the synthetic organic chemists [4]. a&nbsp;few years ago a&nbsp;group of cholestane glycosides (Scheme 19) was isolated from the bulbs of Ornithogalum saundersiae [8], a&nbsp;species of the lily family without any medicinal folkloric background. The major component of the mixture of saponins, OSW-1, exhibited sub-nanomolar antineoplastic activity [35]. While OSW-1 is exceptionally cytotoxic (Table 1) against various tumor cells, it showed little toxicity to normal human pulmonary cells. The cytotoxicity profile of OSW-1 against different cancer cell lines was found to be surprisingly similar to that of the cephalostatins, which appears to imply a&nbsp;related mechanism of action [36]. In this review article the synthetic efforts towards these compounds are described. One of the key features of any attempted synthesis of bis-steroidal pyrazines is the central heterocyclic ring. The classical method of pyrazine synthesis (Schemes 3-7) involves the dimerization of a-amino ketones [13]. An obvious disadvantage of a-amino ketones dimerizations is their unsuitability for unsymmetrical cross-coupling. Various methods for preparation of unsymmetrical pyrazines (Schemes 9-10) were developed [21-23]. However, the preparation of suitably functionalized steroid units is still an uphill challenge, although a&nbsp;significant progress in this endeavor was achieved. This is exemplified among others by the synthesis of cephalostatin 1 (Schemes 14-17) [26]. The highly active \"interphylal\" hybrid analogues, ritterostatins and ornithostatins (Scheme 18), were also obtained [42]. Since saponin OSW-1 contains a&nbsp;relatively simple steroid skeleton, it is an attractive synthetic goal. The synthesis of the OSW-1 aglycone [36, 38], and later the saponin OSW-1 (Schemes 20-24) [37], was successfully accomplished. The mode of action of OSW-1 and of the cephalostatin family is not known yet, but it seems that an oxocarbenium ion (Scheme 25), which could be generated from both types of compounds, is the likely intermediate responsible for their cytotoxicity [42].",

In spite of the fact that cyclitols have been known since the 18th century, the majority of significant achievements in this field is seen during the late 90-ties of the 20th century.\nThe first section of this review deals with general information on the nomenclature, structural features ([2-6]; Schemes 1 and 2), configuration ([6, 7]; Schemes 3 and 4) and conformation ([8]; Scheme 5; Table1) of the cyclitols.\nThe second section is concerned with the occurrence (Table 2) and biological properties of the inositols, in particular of myo-inositol and its derivatives (Schemes 7 and 8). a&nbsp;mechanism of action of myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (1,4,5-IP3) as a&nbsp;secondary messenger has been outlined in Scheme 9.\nThe third section discusses the occurrence and biological activity of the other cyclitols of structures illustrated by the formulae in Schemes 10 through 15.\nThe fourth section is confined to aminocyclitols antibiotics. Their names occurrence, mode of action and formulae of main representatives of this class of compounds are summarized in Table 3 and in Figs. 1 through 8.\nThe last section descibes common methods of preparation of the cyclitols.

            "abstract": "The Mitsunobu reaction is a&nbsp;versatile method for the alkylation of various Bronsted-Lowry acids (HA) by alcohols, proceeding in neutral media in a&nbsp;presence of the redox system which traditionally consists of diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD, Fig. 2.1) and triphenylphosphine (TPP, Fig. 3.1). The reaction proceeds probably along the generally accepted path shown in Fig. 1. The key step of the process proceeds according to the SN2 mechanism and results in one of the most useful attributes of the reaction, namely complete configurational inversion at the carbinol carbon (details of the mechanism and applications of the reaction can be found in reviews: [2-8]).\nThe reaction, however, has a&nbsp;serious limitation - the acidic component has to have pKa smaller than 13 for the reaction to proceed smoothly. Moreover, the classical methodology of the reaction suffers from low yields when applied to secondary alcohols [32].\nIn recent years, in order to overcome these drawbacks and expand the versatility of the original combination of the Mitsunobu mediators, significant progress in the reaction methodology has been made, mainly due to the work of Tsunoda and It\u00f4. Two types of new mediators have been developed to replace the azodicarboxylate-TPP system. The first one is an N,N,N',N'-tetrasubstituted azodicarboxamide (Fig. 4) - tributyl phosphine (Fig. 3.2) system. All azodicarboxamide derivatives were found to be more efficient than traditional DEAD in the Mitsunobu reaction, especially for less acidic HX. N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylazodicarboxamide, TMAD, gives the best overall results among acyclic amides [20], whereas 4,7-dimethyl-3,5,7-hexahydro-1,2,4,7-tetraazocin-3,8-dion, DHTD (Fig. 4.4), in combination with TBP was found to be unique in mediating the formation of the C-C bond with sec-alcohols at room temperature [24,29]. The other type of new mediators in the Mitsunobu reaction, structurally based on betaine (Fig. 5), is cyanomethylenetrialkylphosphorane (e.g. CMBP, and CMMP, Fig. 6) [26]. The phosphorane reagents are generally less active at room temperature, but in higher temperatures they are, esp. CMMP, better than DHTD-TBP and afford satisfactory alkylation of secondary alcohols. Furthermore, the phosphorane reagents mediate the reaction of acids of pKa up to 23.5 [33]. Comparative studies of the C-alkylation revealed the general reactivity of new mediators as TMAD-TBP ( DHTD-TBP ( CMBP ( CMMP [31].",

            "abstract": "Organosilicon derivatives of b-diketones of a&nbsp;general formula (1) have a&nbsp;wide range of possible applications, mainly because of the presence of b-diketonate moiety showing excellent properties of metal ion chelation and relatively easily undergoing conversion to other groups, as shown in Scheme 1. a&nbsp;particularly interesting subject of study are the compounds whose substituent R contains silyl groups (see formula (3)), capable of reacting with surface hydroxyl groups of inorganic support, e.g. silica, or of formation of polysilioxane polymers, as shown in Scheme 2.\nIn the paper, two most often used methods of synthesis of this group of compounds: hydrosilylation and halogen substitution are discussed on the example of derivatives of acetylacetone, the most common representatives of 1,3-diketones.\nCatalytic hydrosilylation of the derivatives containing unsaturated carbon-carbon bond in the substituent is usually non-selective and proceeds on both -C=C- bond and carbonyl groups. More effective method is substitution of halogens in the organic group of an appropriate organosilicon compound, usually of the type described by formula (15). This reaction is also non-selective, since besides the desired products of C-alkylation a&nbsp;substantial amounts of the products of O-alkylation appears. However, a&nbsp;careful choice of solvents and other reagents e.g. a&nbsp;considerable amount of NaI, increases the selectivity towards the C-alkylation products and allows obtaining them in high yields.\nIn the article the problems related to the products purification and identification by spectroscopic methods are also presented.\nAll the applications of organosiica derivatives of b-diketones presented in Scheme 5 are based on the use of the support modified with b-diketonate moiety.\nExemplary applications of the support modified with b-diketonate moiety for immobilisation of amino acids and metal ions are discussed in detail. The immobilised metal complexes have been applied as stationary phases in gas chromatography and as the starting material for composites containing nanometer-sized metal particles of a&nbsp;controllable and uniform size in an inorganic matrix for magnetic and electronic applications and for use as heterogeneous catalysts or oxygen absorbers.",

Enzymatic degradation of these compounds seems to be a&nbsp;promising option.\nThere are many natural sources of the chlorinated organic compounds, as well as those connected with human activity. The first source dominates [1]. However, human production cannot be ignored, however, due to the considerable toxicity of the compounds produced and their dissemination [2].\nThe mechanisms, by which enzymes called dehalogenases catalyze halogen-carbon bond breaking varies. Dehalogenases following different pathways were isolated from many microorganisms [20-48, 55-58]. Their substrates are usually involved in halorespiration processes, so dehalogenation is involved in carbon source and energy supply, as well [21-22, 27, 39]. Moreover, cometabolic dehalogenation is possible [106, 125-133]. Dehalogenases are also present in mammals. For example, iodine dehalogenases (so called deiodinases) are necessary for thyroid hormones homeostasis [15, 52-56].\nHydrolytic dehalogenases are currently the most studied among all classes of dehalogenases. They include such unusual enzymes as 4-chlorobenzoil-CoA dehalogenase [88-95], which is capable of breaking chlorine - aromatic carbon bond under room temperature and neutral pH, and fluoroacetate dehalogenase, which cleaves the carbon-fluorine bond [81-87]. For some of these enzymes three-dimensional structures are available now and mechanistic details have been studied [85, 93, 103-106, 123]. This contribution summarizes the present knowledge of enzymatic catalysis of this unusual chemical processes with special consideration on reaction mechanism of the best known hydrolytic dehalogenases [73-123].",

            "abstract": "Metal complexes derived from Schiff bases have been known for one hundred years. The complexes have occupied a&nbsp;central role in the development of coordination chemistry. This situation is manifested by huge number of publications ranging from the physicochemical to biochemical relevant studies of these complexes. The reason for this sustained interest in those compounds are undoubtedly many but important among them must be their general ease to preparation, and diverse properties, e.g., their ability to reversibly bind oxygen, catalytic activity, photochromic and thermochromic properties.\nSchiff base are those compound containing the azomethine group (-RHC=N-) and usually formed by the condensation of amine with carbonyl compound. Bases which are effective as coordinating ligands bear a&nbsp;functional group, usually -OH, sufficiently near the site of condensation that a&nbsp;five- or six membered chelate ring can be formed upon reaction with a&nbsp;metal ion. Tautomeric equilibrium of three tautomers is possible for Schiff base compounds: imine, enamine and keto-imine. The presence of the imine and enamine tautomeric forms depends on the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond. It is claimed that enamine form is dominant in napthaldimines while imine form in salicylaldimines. The distribution of the tautomeric equilibrium is strongly depend on the solvents. The presence of keto-imine form is insignificant for Schiff base compounds, but is found in the case of b-diketones and arylimines of b-ketoethers.\nThe most significant complexes of the salicylaldimines are of the types: bi-, tri- and tetracoordinateSchemat 3. The geometry of Schiff base complexes depends on substituent at the coordinating nitrogen atoms. For tetra-coordinate copper(II) complexes different types of geometry is possible. a&nbsp;planar structure has been established for the copper(II) complexes (with bidentate Schiff base) where the substituent is hydrogen atom, hydroxyl, methyl, n-butyl or n-amyl group. In the other hand the copper(II) complexes where the substituent is isopropyl or tert-butyl are pseudo-tetrahedral.\nFor tetra-coordinate cobalt(II), either a&nbsp;square-planar or pseudo-tetrahedral geometry is possible. a&nbsp;pseudo-tetrahedral structure has been established for the cobalt(II) complexes (with bidentate Schiff base) where the substituent is n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclohexyl or aryl group. Cobalt(II) complexes with bidentate Schiff bases where the substituent is hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group have a&nbsp;planar geometry, because of formation hydrogen bonding between hydrogen (from hydroxyl group) and oxygen (from aldehyde linkage). Geometry of this type is characteristic for cobalt(II) complexes witch Schiff base tetradentate (e.g., with salicylidene-ethylenediamine).\nThe aim of this account is to summarize the result of studies of structural and spectroscopic properties on Schiff bases and their complexes. These have been reviewed based on 104 articles.",

            "abstract": "High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) [1-6] was born of the marriage of the powerful separation mechanisms of electrophoresis with the instrumentation and automation concepts of chromatography and it has developed into an exciting and extremely powerful analytical technique in recent years. Numerous advantages, such as rapid analysis times, high separation efficiencies, low consumption of chemicals and simplicity of the instrument makes HPCE competitive to other separation techniques. One of the greatest advantages is its diverse application range, mainly due to a&nbsp;numerous modes of separation. Originally considered primarily for the analysis of biological macromolecules, it has proved useful for separations of compounds such as amino acids, vitamins, pesticides, inorganic ions, organic acids, dyes, surfactants, peptides and proteins, carbohydrate, oligonucleotides and DNA restriction fragments, and even whole cells and virus particles. Moreover HPCE makes the separation of chiral compounds possible.\nHowever one restraint of the HPCE techniques is the low concentration sensitivity as a&nbsp;consequence of limited optical pathlength for directed on-capillary photometric detection (the most popular HPCE mode of detection) and the limited volume of sample solution that can be injected into the capillary. Therefore one of the greatest challenges in the area of HPCE methods development is to lower limits of detection (LLD) which is at least an order of magnitude higher than in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nSeveral on-line strategies have been demonstrated to decrease LLD in HPCE, like introducing detector cell with extended pathlenth [7-11], powerful detectors i.e., laser-induced fluorescence [12,13], on-line preconcentrators with the use of solid-phase extraction materials, coated/impregnated membranes [14] or ion-exchange flow injection system coupled to capillary electrophoresis [15].\nAmong different remedies, on-capillary concentration techniques are easy to apply and do not require alteration of HPCE instrumentation, which are isotachophoretic preconcentration, sample stacking ( originally developed for ionic compounds, and recently introduced for micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) sweeping technique.\nMechanisms of concentration in diverse techniques are different. The concentration effect in isotachophoresis (ITP) relies on the adjustment of the concentration of the dilute sample to the higher concentration of the leading electrolyte [16-19]. Preconcentration by ITP can be performed online [20-22] or in coupled columns [23-27]. In sample stacking [28-33], the concentration effect relies on the difference in electrophoretic velocities between the high- and low-conductivity zones (background electrolyte and sample zones, respectively). Sample stacking technique can be performed in CZE [34-50] as well as in MEKC [51-63] mode. From 10 to more than 1000-fold improvements in detector response have been documented. Sweeping [64-68], a&nbsp;new concept in MEKC, is defined as the picking and accumulating of analyte molecules by pseudostationary phase that enters and fills the sample zone upon application of voltage. As on-capillary concentration technique, it has provided more than 5000-fold increases in detection sensitivity. Recently developed a&nbsp;cation-selective exhaustive injection and sweeping technique [69] improves peak heights of cation analytes a&nbsp;million-fold.",

            "abstract": "Radiation chemistry, i.e. the chemical changes initiated by the absorption of ionizing radiations, have to be considered in three chapters of discussions on the mechanisms of origins of life on Earth.\ni: Much higher level of ionizing radiations on Earth than now, has given rise to intensive radiation chemistry. It played an important r\u00f4le in the formation of prebiotic organic compounds, by the abstraction of electrons from simple compounds, and leaving positive species, also very reactive. In the subsequent processes, free radicals were formed, which created new combinations and even the formation of compounds of increased molecular weight; chemical chain reactions were also initiated, all entirely at ambient temperature. However, all these reactions were not chiral in their nature, and, as far as the experiments indicate, were not able to replicate or to be amplified.\nii: In the stadium of the creation of life in the \"soup\" formed by different variations of high energy chemistry, radiation chemistry does not seem to be important. In spite of initial great hopes, created by physicists, the reactions initiated by ionizing radiations were of low enantioselectivity i.e. were not able to enrich one of the enantiomere, or amplify effects which could appear initially. In particular, the hopes laid in the role of the violation of parity, e.g. in the case of b-radiation, as the force promoting chirality, were not fulfilled [c.f. 16].\niii: In the lack of reasonable mechanisms for the origins of life on Earth, many researchers are looking for origins of life from the outside of the Earth. However, that approach does not solve the problem of chiral synthesis and creates additional problems of the transportation of living matter. In that respect the radiation chemistry and its biological consequence - radiobiology is univocal: ionizing radiations, filling the universe, of action extended for years, cause total inactivation of every life, even the primitive one, like in the shape of viruses. The main destructive chemistry is dehydrogenation of live organisms and dry spores, which occurs even at low temperatures, close to absolute zero. Much lower doses, of single Gy (grays) to the whole body are sufficient to destroy the human life, already during the travel to and back from Mars. The shielding atmosphere of gases around the Earth is equivalent to 10 meters thick layer of concrete. a&nbsp;construction and operation of a&nbsp;ship, which could secure the survival of the crew, by making conditions of radiation background as safe as on Earth, is impossible. For the same reasons, radiation chemistry excludes the arrival of \"aliens\", E.T. etc on Earth. Radiation chemistry does not exclude the possibility of Life in any part of the Universe, sufficiently shielded, but shows impossiblity of the transportation of live precursors of our life to the Earth. The Life on Earth originated here and any models of its formation, if true, have to be a&nbsp;subject of reconstruction in the laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Flavonoids are a&nbsp;large group of naturally occurring phenolic compounds widespread in plant kingdom. Over 4000 chemically unique flavonoids have been identified in plants. They are categorised into classes depending on the structure of the central heterocyclic ring (table 1) and within each class according to the hydroxylation pattern or other substitutents.\nSince many years flavonoids are known to display different pharmacological and biological activities, but the most important is capillary protective effect and antioxidant activity. Recently increasing attention is focused on flavonoids as natural antioxidants.\nA number of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen 1O2 and radicals: O2-\u00b7, \u00b7OH, \u00b7OOH, NO\u00b7 as well as alkyl peroxyl free radicals are regularly produced in our body. They damage lipids, proteins and DNA and participate in pathogenesis and aging. Organism possess a&nbsp;wide array of antioxidant physiological defences. However in situation of oxidative stress additional exogenous antioxidants are needed to limit damage in biological systems. The natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, tocopherols, carotenoids and flavonoids contribute to this defence.\nThe recent increase of interest in antioxidant activity of flavonoids is due to their ubiquitous presence in fruits and vegetables as well as in tea, wine and beer. The dietary intake of flavonoids - 25mg to 1g/days far exceeds that of vitamin E and carotenoids [6]. However, the antioxidant activity of different flavonoids differs so much that their composition is much more important than the total content.\nFlavonoids are able to scavenge ROS and alkyl peroxyl radical due to their electron donating properties. The position and degree of hydroxylation is of primary importance for antioxidant activity of flavonoids (table 3). Tea and wine are very rich in flavonoid compounds and their antioxidant activity is well documented by different laboratories [17,19,30-38].\nHowever there has been extensive debate over the last few years on the biological significance in vivo of flavonoids antioxidants activity. Nearly nothing of ingested compounds survives in the body, as they are largely metabolised by tissues or by the colon microflora. In human plasma quercetin is mostly present as conjugate derivatives such as glucoronides and sulphates [6,40,42,43]. It is not clear what is the antioxidant activity of flavonoids metabolites, as well as their real effectiveness in organism. So one should be careful with conclusion concerning flavonoids effectiveness in vivo, on the basis of their antioxidant activity determined in vitro.",

            "abstract": "Supported noble metal catalysts are used in a&nbsp;large number of commercially important processes, including hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, naphtha reforming and automotive exhaust catalysis. It is a&nbsp;well-known fact that support influences the catalytic activity and the selectivity of the supported metal particles. The most striking effect is the so-called strong metal - support interaction (SMSI) in which a&nbsp;metal / support catalyst is reduced at a&nbsp;high temperature (773 K) and the metal loses, at least partially, its chemisorptive properties with respect to H2 and CO. This effect was first discovered by Tauster at al.[2, 3] on titania and then extended to other reducible supports [20, 21].\nSeveral explanations have been given to account for the loss of chemisorptive and catalytic properties: the occurrence of an electronic effect with an electron transfer between the support and the metal particles [76, 101-103, 105, 109, 110, 125], the formation of intermetallic compounds [66, 70], and the decoration of the metal by support mobile species [51, 60, 61, 64, 67, 69]. Another model describing the metal - support interaction and based on theoretical calculations suggests that the electron density in small metal particles is shifted toward nearby cations of the support [112]. Recently a&nbsp;new model has been proposed, in which the decrease in the activity of metal clusters can be ascribed to a&nbsp;decrease in the ionization potential of the metal particles which is directly induced by the Coulomb potential of the support [127].",

            "abstract": "Polyoxometalates (POM) form a&nbsp;unique class of compounds of special properties with wide applications [1, 2]. Chemistry of POM is an important subarea of modern inorganic chemistry. In continuation of our earlier work, published in this journal [2], we present here studies on spectroscopic characterisation of POMs and their lanthanide(III) complexes (Ln/POM).\nA nomenclature system including trivial and systematic names, reflecting information on composition and structure of POM is shortly described. Methods of synthesis of polyanions having inorganic and organic counter cations and results of studies related to POM structure and their Ln(III) complexes are briefly reviewed. Useful techniques for the verification of POMs and Ln/POM compositions and determination of components [37, 44, 46], including elemental and thermogravimetric analysis, IR and Raman spectroscopy [37, 44, 46] as well as the new spectrophotometric methods for determination of tungsten and molybdenum [18] and for simultaneous determination of these elements [39] in structures of POMs and their Ln/POM complexes are presented. An important role of the FTIR spectra (Fig.3) in characterisation of POMs and LnPOM complexes is shown [40]. Forms of POM complexes such as: sandwiched Ln(POM)2, encapsulated within the cavity of the POM and Ln2POM were studied with the use of absorption spectra (in the Nd(III) hypersensitive band (Figs. 4 and 5) and Eu(III) luminescence spectroscopy [31, 38, 40, 41, 44]. Luminescence (excitation and emission) spectra and luminescence lifetime measurements, recorded for Eu(III) complexes in solid and aqueous solutions at room temperature (Tab. 1), and luminescence quantum yield of Eu(III) ion, were used for characterisation of the species [38, 40, 41]. Influence of ionic strength on the complex formation in solution is also presented [41]. The use of EPR method to study magnetic properties and symmetry of the Gd/POM complexes is discussed. Studies shown that Gd(III) ion can be useful as a&nbsp;probe to study of a&nbsp;local environment of the host metal site in terms of symmetry and coordination in Gd/POM [42, 43].",

            "abstract": "In this review the current concepts of lipophilicity phenomenon are described. It especially deserves special attention in medicinal chemistry. Lipophilicity is the factor of crucial importance in biological action of chemical substances. It is the main physico-chemical determinant influencing the bioavailability, permeability and frequently the toxicity of drugs. Lipophilicity is thus one of the most important factors in research aimed at rational designing of new drugs, what is of great and still growing importance nowadays.\nIn the present review the current definitions of lipophilicity and hydrophobicity are discussed. Next, the role of lipophilicity of drugs in living organisms is widely reviewed. The experimental methods of estimation of biological lipophilicity are described in their historical development.\nThe most widely used method of measuring the lipophilicity of compounds is nowadays the liquid chromatography technique, especially in reversed phase mode (according to the definition of lipophilicity). RP-HPLC is a&nbsp;fast and very precise tool for determination of lipophilicity in a&nbsp;wide range of chemical compounds. In presented paper the influence of the chromatographic systems are described with special attention on novel stationary phases which closely mimic the biological environment (e.g., Immobilized Artificial Membrane phase). Next, the procedures for the determination of chromatographic lipophilicity parameters for a&nbsp;set of derivatives in polycratic and gradient modes are described. The importance of different retention parameters and their usefulness in assessing lipophilicity are widely examined.\nFinally, a&nbsp;brief description of calculating methods of lipophilicity estimations is presented.",

            "abstract": "In this review, selected chemical techniques such as TLC, UV-VIS, GC, HPLC and microbiological procedures (published since 1960) used for simultaneous determination of fat-soluble vitamins in different matrices have been discussed. Particular attention has been given to HPLC methods, not only in terms of chromatographic conditions, but also in comparison with other separation techniques.\nHPLC methods have been shown to have clear advantages over existing chemical or microbiological assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity and sample throughput for the analysis of these vitamins. In order to assist the analyst in the selection of a&nbsp;particular procedure, certain chromatographic conditions have been listed for this purpose. However, as currently, no specific HPLC procedures can be recommended, it was decided to develop new methods for these vitamins.\nWithin the past 30 years, HPLC has become the predominant method for separation and quantification of fat-soluble vitamins. The two major, distinct methods of HPLC separation are referred to as normal-phase chromatography and reverse-phase chromatography. To generalise, reverse-phase HPLC is frequently preferred for analysis of biological samples as the columns are more easily purged of any contaminants and sample separation is usually less sensitive to slight changes in mobile-phase composition. a&nbsp;summary of HPLC systems used for fat-soluble vitamins analysis is provided in Table 1 [60-106] and 2 [107-152] in format: compounds determined, matrix, sample preparation and clean up, column, mobile phase, detection, time of analysis, reference.\nFinally, this paper describes a&nbsp;procedure for the simultaneous determination of vitamin a&nbsp;(retinol acetate, palmitate), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol acetate) and alphacalcidol in capsules from a&nbsp;single sample extract using reverse phase HPLC and column backflushing techniques [162-165]. The procedure eliminates saponification, lengthy extractions and sample workup. It is specific to the compounds of interest, shows very good internal precision and is free of interference compared to current published methods.",

            "abstract": "In general, quantum-chemical methods for prediction of the outcome of cycloaddition reactions can be classified into three groups, depending on the particular reaction steps. The least used first group comprises the reactivity indexes, which are based on the analysis of stationary states of substrates. The second group contains the indirect methods of determination of activation energy, such as PMO, FMO and BL. The third group includes the methods relying on finding and characterization of critical structures on the corresponding potential energy hypersurface.\nBL and PMO methods can be applied only for the reactions that obey the principle of non-intercrossing of the energy profiles. These methods are mutually complementary and are used for description of different reaction stages of [2+3] cycloadditions. In the case of a&nbsp;late transition state, the activation energy is controlled primarily by the electronic effects related to formation of new bonds, rather than by the weak donor-acceptor interactions of substrates that are the basis for PMO and FMO methods. Reverse situation occurs when the activation barrier is controlled by an early transition state whose structure resembles substrates. Despite some reported successes, BL method has not become so popular as PMO. This results probably from the narrower scope of potential applications of the former method compared to the later one as well as from the BL method formalism. BL is used for explanation of specific aspects of [2+3] cycloadditions rather than for the reactivity predictions in the literal sense.\nAvailability of fast computers and advanced quantum-chemical software has caused the [2+3] cycloaddition analysis based on localization and characterization of critical points on the potential energy hypersurface has gained popularity in recent years. Such analysis affords information about reactivity of the reagents, reaction mechanism, and, regio-, stereo- and periselectivity of practically any kind of reactions. By this method, transition state geometry and its physicochemical parameters, such as charge distribution, ionization potential, or dipole moment, can be determined. The transition state dipole moment can be used for prediction of the reaction course in solvents of different polarity. Moreover, there are procedures for direct calculations in the presence of a&nbsp;simulated dielectric medium, such as a&nbsp;solvent.",

The optical properties of nucleic bases are discussed in terms of theoretical calculations by Hug and Tinoco [10, 11]. Although nucleic bases are themselves optically inactive, the in-plane (p\u00aep*) as well as out-of-plane (n\u00aep*) transition dipoles induced in their rings are responsible for optical activity of nucleosides, nucleotides and polynucleotides. In a&nbsp;case of nucleosides and nucleotides, which are called \"monomers\", the optical activity originates from the disturbance of the electronic system of a&nbsp;base caused by the presence of a&nbsp;sugar ring. The main factor influencing the character of CD spectra is the torsion angle about the glycosyl bond [14-17]. The experimental spectra of monomers are dominated by in-plane transitions (Rys. 2, 3). In a&nbsp;case of cytidine and guanosine (Rys. 3) the lowering of pH reveals the presence of the out-of-plane transition [14, 24].",

            "abstract": "This review presents chemical and biological aspects of secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria. The main goal of the work was to present studies related to microcystins and nodularins.\nCyanobacteria (blue-green algae) growing both in freshwater and marine environment release to the medium numerous secondary metabolites. Some of cyanobacteria produce lethal toxins (cytotoxins and biotoxins). Therefore, cyanobacteria can be harmful for mammals, birds and fish, and also cause effects on human health. The secondary metabolites are the mostly derivatives of amino acids (see compounds on Scheme 1) and peptides or depsipeptides (Schemes 2-5). The best described among cyanobacteria toxins are the hepatotoxins: microcystins and nodularins. These toxins cause severe intrahepatic haemorrhage and hypovolaemic shock, and act as tumor promoters. Microcystins and nodularins are potent inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A protein phosphatases.\nMicrocystins and nodularins, which are cyclic hepta- or penta-peptides, respectively, consists of various uncoded amino acid residues. The most characteristic and unique amino acid residue is Adda [(2S,3S,8S,9S,4E,6E)-3-amino-9-metoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-deca-4,6-dienoic acid]. Typical isolation of these toxins is realized by extraction combined with reversed-phase chromatography. Structure-activity relationship studies of microcystins and nodularins have revealed indispensability of Adda moiety, and two carboxyl groups of aspartic and glutamic acids, for the activity towards phosphatases. The total synthesis of both toxins represents quite a&nbsp;big challenge because of the necessity of preparation of Adda, as well as many other uncoded amino acids (D-erythro-b-methyl-aspartic acid, Masp; dehydroalanine, Dha, or dehydrobutyrine, Dhb, and their N-methyl derivatives etc.) prior to a&nbsp;final cyclization. Syntheses of Adda, the compound with four chiral centers and two specific configurations at the double bonds, were carried out mostly by the condensation of the previously obtained C1-C4 and C5-C10 fragments (Schemes 6-8).\nMicrocystins and nodularins are quite stable compounds in aqueous solution. They can be destroyed and removed by chlorination, or by treatment with ozone (Scheme 9) combined with ultrafiltration. On the other hand, microcystins and nodularins could be modified for example by esterification (Asp and/or Glu residues), transformation of guanidine moiety of arginine, Michael type addition to dehydroamino acids (Dha, Dhb). These modifications provide less toxic compounds, with interesting biological activities.",

            "abstract": "The review presents the theoretical basis for interpretations of CD spectra of polynucleotides. a&nbsp;simplified version of quantum theory of circular dichroism of a&nbsp;polynucleotide by Tinoco and Johnson [2] is presented in details. It is generally assumed that the optical activity of these polymers is dominated by interactions between dipoles of in-plane transitions occuring at neighbouring bases. The interaction of dipoles coming from different bases strictly depends on geometrical arrangement of bases within the helix. As a&nbsp;result information about geometry of the helix can be inferred from the CD spectra. The circular dichroism caused by the disturbance of the electronic system of a&nbsp;base by the presence of a&nbsp;sugar ring is usually omitted in calculations. Such a&nbsp;theoretical approach allows to understand differences between CD spectra of random DNA and RNA. The distance of a&nbsp;base pair from helix axis appeared to be the main factor responsible for these differences [25]. The approach fails in a&nbsp;case of polymers of non-random sequences, for example containing a&nbsp;repetitive motif of two bases [2, 7, 27]. It is exemplified for the d(CG)n oligomers forming left-handed double helix called Z-DNA, where none of the theoretical calculations is able to predict the inversion of a&nbsp;CD spectrum characteristic for the z&nbsp;form [7, 35, 36].",

            "abstract": "Urea is a&nbsp;ubiquitous compound in nature. It is formed in large amounts as the end product of the catabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by most of the terrestial animals and also used in agriculture as the most common fertilizer. If it were not for its enzymatic hydrolysis that is 1014 times faster than the nonenzymatic degradation, urea would rapidly accumulate in nature causing serious environmental problems. The hydrolysis of urea is catalyzed by urease (urea amidohydrolase EC 3.5.1.5) [1], an enzyme widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, algae, some invertebrates and higher plants, the first enzyme ever crystallized (1926) [2] and the first one shown to contain nickel in its active site (1975) [3]. The products of the hydrolysis are ammonia and carbamate, the latter spontaneously decomposing to ammonia and carbonic acid in an uncatalyzed reaction. The products generate an increase in pH. Despite extensive research to date the mechanism of urease action has not been fully elucidated [25a, 55a].\nThe negative effects of both ammonia and the reaction-generated increase in pH brought about by urease activity, have profound medical and agricultural implications [54]. Several ureolytic bacteria have been recognized as pathogenic factors in human/animal infections of urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. In the former they are involved in the urinary stone formation, catheter encrustation and pyelonephritis, and in the latter in chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcers, both caused by Helicobacter pylori, and in hepatic coma. In agriculture urease is essential for converting urea-based fertilizers to utilizable ammonia. Too rapid a&nbsp;hydrolysis, however, results both in plant damage by ammonia toxicity and in the alkalization of soil and finally in the loss of nitrogen by ammonia volatilization, thus creating severe environmental and economic problems. To combat these undesirable ureolytic effects the use of urease inhibitors has been proposed. Final elucidation of the structure of the urease active site and of its catalytic mechanism will substantially facilitate the design of effective urease inhibitors at a&nbsp;molecular level, thus replacing tedious kinetic screening.\nThis paper summarizes the established knowledge on urease and reviews the recent findings on the enzyme.",

The problem of 2'OH protection is described in detail. In this respect acid-labile groups and alkylsilyl groups are compared and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. More detailed discussion is devoted to the phenomenon of the silyl group migration during the synthesis of monomeric units for oligonucleotide chain assembly.

            "abstract": "During the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the catalytic reforming of methane with carbon dioxide. This reaction is considered as more efficient use of natural gas (methane) but also in the context of possible utilization of carbon dioxide. As both CH4 and CO2 are greenhouse gases, this reaction has also important environmental implications.\nIn this review, an emphasis was put on the recent papers, published in the period 1998-2001, which have not been reported in the comprehensive review of Bradford and Vannice [2]. Some basic thermodynamic and kinetic information about the discussed reaction and CH4 and CO2 activation was recalled. Then different types of catalysts were reported, first of all focused on nickel and platinum group based catalysts. New approaches to the mechanisms of the reaction on catalysts Ni/ZrO2 [28, 29] and Ru/SiO2 and Ru/Al2O3 [42] were shown.\nThe major difficulty in practical realization of methane reforming with CO2 is thermodynamically favoured coke formation which deactivates the catalysts. The route leading to the improvement of this situation can be an addition of oxygen or water to the feed gas mixture or developing catalysts that minimize the rate of carbon deposition. The modification of the support, an application of bimetallic catalysts or another complex systems seem to be promising. Some of such systems were reported in the review.\nAmong 112 references cited in this review, 72 were published in the period 1998-2001. Therefore, the authors hope that this contribution presents a&nbsp;useful and reasonable supplement to Bradford and Vannice work [2].",

            "abstract": "The aminopolyphosphonic acids are analogues of aminopolycarboxylic acids in which the carboxyl groups (CO2-) are substituted by the phosphonate moieties (PO32-). Aminopolyphosphonic acids and their derivatives have received considerable attention because of their interesting biological activity and a&nbsp;wide range of uses for industrial, chemical, agricultural and pharmacological purposes.\nThis review discusses coordination preferences of N-substituted iminodi(methylenephosphonic) acids to the divalent metal ions (such as magnesium, calcium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc) in an aqueous solution.\nN-substituted derivatives of iminodi(methylenephosphonic) acids exhibit high complexation efficiency towards divalent metal ions. This results from both dinegatively charged phosphonate groups as well as the imino nitrogen present in their structure. a&nbsp;significant preference for an equimolar stoichiometry has been demonstrated in these systems. The only exeption is the N-2-methyltetrahydrofuryliminodi(methylenephosphonic) acid with a&nbsp;tetrahydrofuryl moiety placed in the sterically favoured position that allows its oxygen atom to be an effective metal binding site. Specific interactions between metal ions and furyl oxygen results in higher binding ability of this ligand and a&nbsp;formation of 1:2 species.\nThe first part of the review deals with the acid-base properties of the considered ligands which are consistent with electronic effect of the substituents attached to the imino nitrogen. The second part of the review describes the binding properties of iminodi(methylenephosphonic) acids in copper(II) complexes. a&nbsp;formation of tridentate bonded species has been demonstrated in these systems. The third part of the review report what is known about magnesium(II), calcium(II) and zinc(II) complexes of the same ligands. While the imino nitrogen is bonded in the predominate complexes in the zinc(II) systems, magnesium(II) and calcium(II) ions prefer a&nbsp;pure phosphonate coordination. Finally, the interactions of manganese(II), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) ions with N-substituted iminodi(methylenephosphonic) acids are described. For these complexes the formation of eight-membered rings is reported.\nCoordination properties of iminodi(methylenephosphonic) acids are important factors to understand the role of the ligands and metal ions in biological systems.",

            "abstract": "L-carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-N-trimethylammonium butyric acid) plays an important role in fats metabolism, acting as an essential carrier of acyl group from cytoplasm into the mitochondria and b-oxidation products from peroxosomes. It is also responsible for detoxication of specific short- and medium-chain fatty acids [1-5]. Although carnitine is not indispensable in food and can be synthesized in the system, its deficiency accompanies many diseases. Deficiency in carnitine is characterised by muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, deposition of fat in muscles, kidneys, liver as well as metabolic acidosis.\nL-carnitine occurs in a&nbsp;free form and esterificated by fatty acids. For diagnostic purposes free and total carnitine are determined after previous ester hydrolysis. Modern methods of carnitine determining are based on reversible reaction of the stoichiometric acetyl-transfer from acetyl-coenzyme a&nbsp;to L-carnitine catalyzed by carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT), and measurement of the content of acetyl-carnitine or free coenzyme a&nbsp;formed [1, 19]. Isomer D-carnitine is inactive in that reaction, nor-carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-dimethylammonium butyric acid) may take part, but this compound does not appear in any biologic materials. Those methods of carnitine determining employ radiometric, spectrophotometric, spectrofluorimetric and enzymatic techniques.\nAmong the other methods of carnitine determining chromatographic methods are most frequently used, especially HPLC, but also GC chromatography is often used. Using HPLC method, one can determine the carnitine level, either immediately or in the form of 4'-bromophenacyl derivatives [46 - 49]. However, some authors have had difficulties in obtaining these derivatives [29] and sensitivity of determination has been not sufficient for biological samples. Various reagents were used to prepare fluorescent carnitine derivatives in the HPLC chromatography with fluorimetric detection [table 1]. The reactor containing immobilized enzymes was also used [58].\nOne can also determine carnitine by means of gas chromatography. This method is based on the disintegration of carnitine at temp. 160 \u00baC in the presence of NaOH and NaBH4 [61, 62]. Under these conditions it is disintegrated into crotonylbetaine, trimethylamine and butyrolacton, which are detected with flame ionization.\nAmong methods used less frequently mass spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis are worth mentioning.\nIndividual O-acyl derivatives content L-carnitine can be determined using the \"radio-exchange\" method or gas chromatography.",

The aim of this review was to stress that the anion recognition is becoming more and more rapidly expanding field of the ion recognition and modern chemistry in general.\nFirst, the general characteristic of the anions was given, including the size, shape, pH dependence and hydration (see Table 1). These parameters were compared with the respective ones for cations. The importance of the anions for the biological processes was shown on some most representative examples, like inorganic phosphate ions. The biological mechanisms of the \"arginine fork\" [18], and phosphate/sulfate recognition selectivity were used to show the importance of hydrogen bonding [11-17]. The synthetic cycle of the ATP exemplified the uniqueness of the rotary synthesis based on anion recognition [24]. The discovery of the mechanism of the rotary synthesis was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1997. The biological membranes and their role in the ion recognition (binding and transportation) were briefly introduced.\nThe most spectacular examples of the molecular recognition were compared with the current achievements of supramolecular chemists. Starting from the pioneering work of Park and Simmons [1] to the very recent dendrimeric structures [65, 66], the anion receptors were reviewed. The authors were not trying to introduce any artificial classification of receptors, because in most of the cases at least two types of non-covalent interactions participate in the recognition process. The usefulness of this approach was discussed on the example of polyammonium receptors recognizing the anions by inseparable electrostatic and H-bonding interactions. The following groups of receptors were described: guanidinium, polyamines/polyammonium, metaloorganic (tin, boron, mercury, ferrocenium, cobaltocenium), metal complexes, porphyrines, expanded porphyrines (saphyrines), calix[n]arenes, catenane, cyclodextrine, and gold nanoparticles.",

            "abstract": "In ecological literature the term \"environmental estrogens\" refers to industrial compounds which contaminate the environment and have estrogen-like biological activity. In a&nbsp;strict sense the term should include also estrogens produced by plants (phytoestrogens) but these are scarcely mentioned by environmentalists who all their attention concentrate on man-made chemicals.\nThe first observation of hormonal activity of an industrial chemical dates back to 1950 when Burlingtion et al. reported that DDT affects the secondary sex characteristics of male birds [3]. Similar observations multiplied in later years but the observed effects were always weak or very weak and did not attract much interest. The situation changed when environmentalists became aware of the huge propaganda potential of estrogenic activity of pesticides such as DDT and begun using that activity as one of the tools helping their efforts to bring about a&nbsp;ban of man-made pesticidal compounds. In many ecological publications the hormonal activity of industrial compounds was suitably enlarged and horrifying scenarios were developed, some of them predicting even the end of mankind due to cancer and catastrophic reduction of fertility [4-7]. As usual, the mass media are happily helping to ring the alarm bells.\nFortunately there are several reasons to dismiss the environmental estrogens scare. First of all, plants such as rice, wheat, cabbage, potatoes and many other contain substantial amounts of compounds with estrogenic activity but are eaten daily without harm. And there are no scientific grounds to believe that industrial estrogens are more harmful than phytohormones.\nSome specific and very recent developments in the field of environmental estrogens include the fertility of males, the alleged synergistic potentiation of weak estrogens and the problem of their cancerogenic activity. The problem of fertility emerged with a&nbsp;publication by Danish scientists [13] who claimed that the sperm counts in otherwise healthy men are very rapidly decreasing. For obvious reasons the problem received much attention and the Danish publication was followed by several papers on sperm counts, e. g. [14, 15]. However, no one was able to confirm the claims of Danish scientists.\nThe problem of synergism ended with a&nbsp;scandal. The paper claiming a&nbsp;thousandfold increase of estrogenic activity when mixtures are applied instead of single compounds [16] was retracted [21] and one of the authors admitted cheating (Science, 294, 763 (2001))\nFinally, the accusation that DDE (one of the metabolites of DDT) is responsible for breast cancer in women [22] was convincingly disproved [23-25]. And so ended the environmental estrogens scare.",

High speed, excellent detection limits, wide dynamic range and possibility of accurate multi-element analysis make the techniques particularly suited to the determination of ppb and sub-ppb levels of the analytes in complex matrices. Mass spectrometric methods offer unique capability of rapid isotopic ratios measurements.\nPlasma techniques have found wide applications in analysis of geological, environmental and clinical samples. They have proved to be very useful in speciation studies due to extremely low sensitivities offered and the ease of on-line combination with separation techniques, in particular with chromatography.\nA brief review of ICP-AES and ICP-MS techniques is presented in the paper. The possibility and limitations of the techniques as analytical tools are discussed. The most important analytical parameters are collected in Table 1. Detailed characteristics of equipment used (Figs 2, 5): sample introduction systems, analyzers (Figs 4a, b and Figs 7-9) and detectors [18, 30, 43] are given.

It is pointed out that 1,2- and 2,3-unasturated pyranosides constitute an important class of intermediates, useful for synthesis of natural and modified antibiotic aminosugars. Glycals derived from 3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxypyranoses and their 1-O-silylated derivatives are useful glycosyl donors for a&nbsp;variety of alcohols. Also anthracycline antibiotics can be obtained from them in simple preparative procedures which are amenable for scale up and technical process development. Moreover, unsaturated pyranoses from 6-deoxy-L- configurational series are useful chiral precursors for anthracycline aglycons synthesis. Remarkably, various synthetic schemes comprising anthracycline antibiotic sugars, aglycons and new synthetic analogues can be traced down to the single common precursor: 3,4-di-O-acetyl-L-rhamnal (24), easily obtained from a&nbsp;commodity chemical (raw material in food industry) L-rhamnose.",

            "abstract": "The isolation, synthesis and biological properties of polyhydroxylated alkaloids (iminosugars) constitute a&nbsp;well-visible trend in organic chemistry nowadays. Due to their structural resemblance to sugars, iminosugars are recognized by glycosidases, the enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. Since glycosidases play a&nbsp;very important role in many biological systems, the iminosugars which inhibit them display interesting biological activities.\nIndolizidines represented by castanospermine, swainsonine and lentiginosine are particularly interesting as they exhibit a&nbsp;variety of important biomedical properties.\nThe present paper is not a&nbsp;survey of the literature, but only deals with syntheses towards lentiginosine, with the aim of illustrating representative approaches in the syntheses of polyhydroxyindolizidines.\nThe high stereoselectivity of both the conjugate addition of hydrazine and the (1,3)-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones to the a,b-unsaturated sugar d-lactones, prompted us to use the adducts of both reactions as substrates for the syntheses of polihydroxyindolizidines.\nThe conjugate addition offers a&nbsp;stereocontrolled entry to derivaties of both D- and L-2-pyrrolidineacetic acids which can be easily transformed into desired indolizidines. As an example, the syntheses of lentiginosine are demonstrated.\nThe (1,3)-dipolar cycloaddition of Brandi's nitrone to the title lactones proceeded with high stereoselectivity in the case of D- and L-glycero lactones, whereas there was a&nbsp;high kinetic resolution in the case of racemic D,L-glycero lactone. It was shown that adducts can be easily transformed into lentiginosine, 7-hydroxylentiginosine and 7,8-dihydroxylentiginosine.",

            "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Proteus from the family Enterobacteriaceae are opportunistic pathogens, which cause mainly wounds and urinary tract infections (UTI), the latter leading to severe complications, such as acute or chronic pyelonephrithis and formation of bladder and kidney stones [6]. Virulence factors and properties of Proteus sp. mediating infectious process are swarming phenomenon, adherence due to the fimbriae or glycocalyx, flagella, invasiveness, urease, amino acids deaminases, proteases, hemolysins, capsular polysaccharide (CPS), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [8, 9]. LPS is an integral component of cell wall of bacteria. It also represents the endotoxin which, after being released from bacterial cells, causes a&nbsp;broad spectrum of pathological effects leading in severe cases to the septic shock. Lipopolysaccharide consists of three parts - O- specific chain (O-antigen), core and lipid A; all of them have been studied in Proteus LPS [14-16]. It has been documented that Proteus is an antigenically heterogeneous genus, principally because of structural differences in its O-specific polysaccharide chain of LPS. The serological classification of P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris shares 60 serogroups : 22 described for P. vulgaris, 33 characteristic for P. mirabilis and 5 common for both P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris [11, 20]. Serological classification of Proteus penneri still remains to be completed.\nProteus O-antigens are branched or linear polysaccharides, built up of oligosaccharide repeating units, varying from a&nbsp;trisaccharide to a&nbsp;hexasaccharide. Acidic O-specific polysaccharides represent the majority of Proteus O-antigens; it was found that 80% of Proteus O-antigens were acidic. Uronic acids and amino sugars usually determine the serological specificity of Proteus O-antigens. Amino sugars in Proteus O-antigens are usually N-acetylated. In many O-antigens, sugars constituents carry an O-acetyl groups. Hexuronic acids either have free carboxyl group or are amidated with the a-amino group of amino acids - lysine, serine, alanine or threonine [23]. Chemical and serological studies have been undertaken with the aim to understand on the molecular level the immunospecificity of Proteus LPS and its potential role during infection of bacteria. The O-antigens and O-antisera against Proteus with defined epitope specificity can be used for serodiagnosis and epidemiological studies. It was found that O-specific polysaccharide Proteus bacteria is involved in creation of glycocalyx which allows bacteria to grow in microcolony or in biofilm. Biofilm protects bacteria against action of antimicrobial agents and leukocytes, and it is also a&nbsp;organic gel-like surrounding contributing to stone formation. LPS from the S form of bacteria, containing all three regions also contributes to their resistance against bactericidal action of serum [10, 23]. The present review is mainly focused on the structure, specificity and biological function of Proteus vulgaris LPS.",

            "abstract": "Carbohydrates are found in nature in variety of forms, in chemical association with a&nbsp;vast number of compounds, including other sugars, and in materials which perform a&nbsp;range of functions varying from structural to specifically functional in many biochemical ways [1]. The attachment of monosaccharide units to other molecules proceeds usually through the anomeric centre by O-, N-, S- or C-glycosidic bond.\nMost synthetically useful glycosylation reaction is nucleophilic displacement at the anomeric centre. It occurs through glycosyl cations, usually from activated leaving groups in suitable glycosyl derivatives, most frequently halides [8] and imidate esters [9].\nThere are so many variables involved in glycoside and disaccharide synthesis that each target compound requires a&nbsp;particular strategy. That is why so many procedures have been developed to provide the regio- and stereocontrol in the glycosylation step [1]. However, these methodes have been known for many years-and still modified-the selective synthesis of glycosides still determines the main challenge in the chemistry of carbohydrates.\nThe aim of this paper is to present the role of palladium-catalyzed methodology in glycosylation reactions.\nThe Heck reaction has been applied first by Daves [24] and Czernecki [25-27] to C-glycosidic synthesis (scheme 1).\nReaction of glycals with various reagents offering nucleophilic carbon centres in the presence palladium-catalyst, affords important means of acces to 2,3-unsaturated C-glycosides (scheme 4) [38-41]. The popularity of this methodology started to flourish when it was found that it was able to control the selectivity by using certain reaction procedures to give fairly predictible results [113].\nAllylic carbonates are well-known compounds that undergo a&nbsp;variety of palladium-catalyzed reactions [11, 49]. This methodology [65, 66] has been applied to synthesis of many alkenyl glycosides [77, 78, 80], (schemes 11-13). The reaction proceeds under neutral and very mild conditions and usually gives only one anomer.\nThe same methodology was extended to the preparation of C-, N-, and S-glycosides as well as unsaturated di- and trisaccharides (Scheme 31), [86, 93]. These products are obtained in good yields by alkylation of ethyl a-O-D2-glycosides, having a&nbsp;leaving group at C-4, with C-, N-, S-nucleophiles, with various carbohydrates or with thiocarbohydrates.\nThe reaction is regio- and stereoselective for the a-erytro enoside, and only stereoselective for a-threo enoside.",

Allyltin derivatives 7 undergo a&nbsp;controlled rearrangement with zinc chloride to dienoaldehydes CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH(OR)3CHO with the trans geometry across the internal double bond (3-E). Dienoaldehydes 3-E react with the C2-Wittig-type reagents [phosphoranes: Ph3P=CH-COR or phosphonates: (MeO)2P(O)CH2COR] to afford trienes 18 [CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH(OR)3CH=CH-C(O)-R), which undergo the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction to give optically pure highly oxygenated bicyclo[4.3.0]indene derivatives 5 with the trans junction between the five and six-membered rings.\nAlternatively, the dienoaldehyde 3-E can be converted into - regioisomeric to 18 - triene 24 [CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH(OR)3C(O)-CH=CH-R], cyclization of which furnish optically pure bicyclo[4.4.0]decane derivatives 4 with the cis junction between both six-membered rings.

Both isomers 7 and 15 might be converted into the trans dienoaldehyde 3-E by action of ZnCl2. However, thermal behavior of these regioisomers is different. The primary derivative 7 is stable up to at least 170 \u00b0C, while the secondary one (15) undergoes elimination of the tributylstannyl moiety already at 140 \u00b0C (boiling xylene) to afford dienoaldehyde with the cis-geometry across the internal double bond (3-Z). Such aldehyde was used for the preparation of - isomeric to 5 - derivative of bicyclo[4.3.0]indene with the cis-configuration between both rings (23).\nThe stereochemistry of all these cyclizations might be rationalized assuming the endo-transition states of the intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions.

            "abstract": "Green chemistry is the design, development, and implementation of chemical processes or products to reduce or eliminate the use and generation of substances hazardous to human health and the environment [6]. Its aim is to combine technological and economic progress with the safeguarding of the environment, which is one of the challenges of the new millennium [2]. To help to achieve this goal, a&nbsp;set of twelve principles of green chemistry was formulated by Anastas and Warner [7]. These principles apply to a&nbsp;whole chemical process and to its main stages, which are: starting materials (or feedstock), reaction types and reagents, solvents and reaction conditions, and chemical products [7].\nThis review only covers some of the important efforts and achievements of green chemistry. In Section 3.1 some saccharide- based syntheses are presented. Both simple sugars (glucose, lactose) [17,18,21,24] (Schemata 2,3), and polymeric saccharides [29] (Scheme 4), as well as biomass [36,37] (Schemata 5,6) have been successfully transformed into valuable chemicals. In Section 3.2, new reaction types fulfilling the atom economy principle formulated by Trost [46] are described. The focus is on new oxidation reactions of olefins using clean oxidants: hydrogen peroxide and non-toxic, water-soluble iron catalysts [55,57,60] (Schemata 9-12, Fig.3), and oxygen [70,72,73] (Schemata 14-17). New possibilities of replacing toxic hydrogen cyanide [75,76] and phosgene [77,78,84] with safer reagents (e.g., dimethyl carbonate) were another topic of this Section. Section 3.3 deals with new reaction media. Water emerged as a&nbsp;non-toxic, environmentally benign and cheap solvent for many organic reactions, as it has several advantages: water soluble substrates (e.g., carbohydrates) can be used directly, the aqueous catalyst solution can be recycled easily, and no inert gas atmosphere is needed [94,97-101]. The discovery of water soluble transition metal complexes made it possible to use aqueous/organic biphasic systems which have benefits in catalyst separation and recycling. Such a&nbsp;system has been used, for instance, in the industrial propylene hydroformylation process [120,121,123] (Scheme 29). Many other reactions performed in biphasic systems were reported (Table 2). Water soluble rare earth trifluoromethane sulfonates have been shown to be strong Lewis acids [135,137,138].\nSupercritical fluids have been used as new reaction media; they posses a&nbsp;unique combination of gas- and liquid- like properties. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO<sub>2</sub>) and supercritical water (scH2O) were mostly exploited. New polymerization processes in scCO<sub>2</sub> were proposed [158,159] (Scheme 32) and new surfactants for scCO<sub>2</sub> were discovered [158,159,161-165] (Fig. 4). Promising possibilities of performing oxidation reactions in scH2O were reported, as many organic compounds and oxygen are soluble in scH2O [178,179,183]. Ionic liquids, which are characterized by a&nbsp;lack of measurable vapour pressure, constitute another group of neoteric solvents (Fig. 5). They can serve both as powerful solvents (e.g., in extraction processes) and as reaction media with catalytic properties [185 - 189].\nThe last Section (3.4) deals with chemical products safe for humans and for the environment. The focus is on polymers, pesticides and surfactants that are produced in a&nbsp;large volume. New \u201cmetallocene polyolefins\u201d [196-201] and water soluble, biodegradable polymers [202-204] seem to fulfil this requirement. Selective pesticides, non-toxic to mammals, birds, and beneficial insects have been implemented, among them biopesticides [208-210] (Table 3). Biodegradable \u201csugar surfactants\u201d [214-217] and chemodegradable, acetal-type surfactants (Figs. 6,7) have been synthesized and some of them are already industrially produced [11,219,222-228].\nThe review ends with some remarks on the perspectives of green chemistry in the near future (Section 4). In this context, the need for far-reaching educational initiative to promote the scientific principles of green chemistry, which were developed and implemented to the benefit of society, is stressed [2, 243, 244].",

            "abstract": "The existence of vitamin D was discovered as a&nbsp;consequence of human disease. Vitamin D deficiency in childhood produces rickets, which is characterized by inadequate calcification of cartilage and bone. In rickets, the whole bony structure is soft and flexible, so that can hardly support the superposed weight of the body. Rickets was common in the 19th century, when the industrial revolution caused change of an agrarian society to an industrial society. The population in large measure spent much more time inside buildings, which shielded them from ultraviolet light. It was proved that sun light and cod liver oil are equally active in preventing and curing rickets. Further studies led to the discovery of an anti-rachitic vitamin D. a&nbsp;deficiency in vitamin D impairs bone formation in growing animals. The precursor of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) present in the skin. Irradiation of this compound results in the formation of previtamin D3, which spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin D3 (thermal rearrangement). Vitamin D3 is further converted by enzymatic hydroxylation reactions occurring in the liver and kidneys into an active hormone, which was isolated and identified as 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Other biologically active metabolites and analogues of vitamin D were also described. The vitamin D endocrine system was primarily recognized for its critical role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The active form of the vitamin, 1a,25-(OH) 2D3, acts on the intestine, bone, and kidney to increase serum levels of these two elements. Receptors for 1a,25-(OH) 2D3 have also been detected in a&nbsp;wide variety of target tissues and cell types, which are not involved in the calcemic activity. The non-classical actions of 1a,25-(OH) 2D3 have suggested a&nbsp;multitude of potential therapeutic applications of the vitamin D hormone for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders (e.g. cancer and psoriasis), immune dysfunction and endocrine disorders. a&nbsp;number of new drugs based on the vitamin D analogues has been recently introduced to the pharmaceutical market.\nThe story of vitamin D is not finished yet.",

In the reactions with trans-b-arylnitroethylenes, trans-configuration of the substituents at C-3 and C-4 positions of the heterocyclic ring is always favored. However, in the case of trans-b-alkylnitroethylenes, usually the 3,4-cis-isomers are formed in majority. If steric effects do not affect significantly the reaction course, the observed regioselectivity can be well explained in the terms of FMO or HSBA theory. The reaction stereoselectivity is hard to predict in advance. It seems that it depends on the equilibrium between the two complementary interactions in the reaction transition state: the attractive secondary overlaps of the reactants pz-orbitals, and the repulsive steric interactions of the reactants substituents. In some cases, the possibility of (Z)-(E) isomerisation of nitrones under reaction conditions has to be taken into account (Scheme 2).\nChemical properties of the cycloadducts resulting from the presence of nitro group in the isoxazolidine ring have also been discussed.",

            "abstract": "Learning the biochemical properties of Cr(III) and Cr(VI), especially mutagenic activity of Cr(VI) caused quick development of investigation of Cr speciation in environmental samples. Complex composition of matrix, possible course of the redox reaction of Cr and its low concentration often make difficult application of direct methods of determination of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The investigation of speciation of Cr by preliminary separation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) and their preconcentration eliminates a&nbsp;series of analytical problems and creates a&nbsp;possibility of Cr detection with various techniques, also in coupled systems.\nThe Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in systems HPLC-ICP-AES [7-10], HPLC-ICP-MS [7-9, 11-16], HPLC-AAS [15-18], HPLC-FI-AAS [19-26], HPLC-UV [15, 27-32] were separated, preconcetrated and determined. Independently from HPLC [7-34] also other chromatographic techniques were used [35-38]. Ion-exchange was applied mainly to separation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) [39-42, 45-48, 51], as well as to separation of Cr(VI) [36,53-57] or Cr(III) [58] from other ions. To separation of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) there were applied: sorption [62-70], biopolymer coating [72] and bioaccumulation [71]. Separation and preconcentration of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) is possible by applying solvent extraction. To extraction of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) and their separation were applied amines [28, 73-76, 98, 108, 110], ammonium salts [77, 104] and non-ammonium salts [83, 84], amine oxides [58, 78-82, 106], carboxylic and hydroxycarboxylic acids [99-101] and other reagents [58, 85-90, 102, 103, 105, 107]. To separation and preconcentration of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) there are proposed ion-exchange membrane [111-115], electrophoresis [36, 116-118], precipitation and co-precipitation [36, 58, 119-123] and other methods of separation [58, 120, 124, 125].\nDetermination of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) without preliminary separation is possible in environmental samples, in which at the stage of preparing to analysis or during analysis the redox reactions with participation of Cr do not proceed. For direct determination of Cr(VI) spectrophotometric method (UV) is applied with the use of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide [120, 126-150], methylene blue [151], iodonitrotetrazolium chloride [152,153], tetrazolium violet [153], 5-Br-PADAP [154], dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate [155], rhodamine 6G [156, 157], nitrotetrazolium blue [158] and neotetrazolium chloride [159], whereas for determination of Cr(III) there were applied: EDTA [160-162], triphenylmethane reagents [163-168], PAR [169-172] and PAN [173]. For direct determination of Cr(VI) or Cr(III) polarography [174, 175] and others methods [66, 122, 176-180] were applied.",

            "abstract": "Sonoelectrochemistry is the field of the research dealing with the influence of power ultrasound on electrochemical processes. The dominant effect of the ultrasound in electrochemical systems is the enhancement of mass transport by macrostreaming due to the propagation of an acoustic wave and microstreaming related to the acoustic cavitation phenomena and microjetts formation on the electrode surface. These effects are responsible for large enhancement of the current and significant modification of voltammograms recorded at stationary electrodes. In the presence of power ultrasounds voltammograms show steady-state sigmoidal shape with an oscillatory behavior. a&nbsp;simple planar diffusion layer model may be employed to analyze the current data.\nUltrasound can also influence physical and chemical properties of electrode surface. Cavitation induced by ultrasound as well as shear forces can cause cleaning of the electrode surface and prevent adsorption and precipitation processes. Sonication can activate the electrode surface, too. High power ultrasound can also change the morphology of the electrode surface.\nUltrasounds are succesfuly applied to a&nbsp;wide range of electrochemical technologies. There are frequently used in electrometalurgy for metal coating, electropolishing, electromachining, and electrochemical etching. The use of ultrasound allow eleiminate highly toxic compounds from the electroplating procedures.\nUltrasound can significantly improve electrochemical synthesis processes. These improvements include enhancment diffusion and trerefore increase of yields and current efficiency, suppresed electrode fouling and alteration of reaction mechanism, and product selectivity control. Polymer films formed at the electrode surface in sonicated solution show better morrphology and mechanic properties.\nHigh rate of mass transfer under sonoelectrochemical conditions allows kinetic study of fast heterogeneous charge transfer processes and chemical steps coupled with rlectron transfer reaction.\nThe application of ultrasound to analytical procedure can provide numerous benefits of which enhanced mass transport and in situ cleaning of the electrode are the most important. Sonoelectrochemistry analytical methods exhibit high sensitivity and good reproducibility. There are also less time consuming procedures comparison to conventional electroanalytical methods prformed under silent conditions.\nUltrasound allows the formation of emmulsions in heterogeneous systems of immiscible organic and aqueous solvents without stabilizing agents simply by mechanical forces atributed to cavitation processes which arise at the liquid/liquid phase boundaries. Sonoelectrochemical is also used in nanotechnology for formation of nano-size metalic and non-metalic particles. The electrochemical study of electrode reactions of organic reagents in polar water solution can be carried out in these systems. Emulsions stabilized by ultrasound can be also used in quantitative analysis of water insoluble samples.",

Despite the overwhelming advantages of this technique, it has not yet found widespread use in molecular biology labs in comparison with the slab gel electrophoresis [39]. The main reason for the low acceptance of this method is performing separation in a&nbsp;single capillary which is analogous to using only one lane on a&nbsp;slab gel; despite the high speed of the separation, the overall throughput is still low.\nTo comply with the current needs for fast and high throughput analysis, especially in the field of DNA sequencing, two approaches have been introduced: a&nbsp;multicapillary scheme called capillary array electrophoresis [6-17,40-59] and a&nbsp;multichannel system etched into the surface of microchips [5,18-38,60-99].\nCapillary array electrophoresis (CAE) was first introduced in 1992 [9]. The search for a&nbsp;comprehensive instrument was achieved by several groups seeking an instrument capable of fast, automated, sensitive and most important of all, rugged operation [10-13]. In CAE electrokinetic injection is the most popular method for sample loading [47,48]. However adopting this mode of injection for DNA sequencing requires a&nbsp;thorough sample clean-up [42-45]. To inject unpurified samples a&nbsp;so-called \u2018base-stacking\u2019 method has been described [46]. One of the major problem in CAE is detection as it has to meet plenty of demands, among which the most important are: high speed, high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. Numerous approaches have been developed to address these challenges using either scanning [53,54] or imaging technologies [12,13,55-59].\nCapillary electrophoresis (CE) on microchips is based upon microfabrication techniques developed in the semiconductor industry [65-69]. The design of microchips for CE has undergone significant development from simple single-channel structures to increasingly complex ones capable of proceeding various analytical steps [70-85]. Sensitive detection schemes are essential in microfabriacted devices in CE due to extremely small size of the detection cell. Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) is so far the most popular for this purpose [86-89]. Other methods successfully coupled to microchips include mass spectrometry [92-95], electrochemical detection [96,97], Raman spectroscopy [98] and holographic refractive index detection [99].",

Special emphasis has been put on the genesis of radon and its migration in these environments, with the dominant role of physical processes, in contrast to almost complete chemical passivity of this element. Another discussed issue is the special significance of the physico-chemical properties of the medium and the centre for radon migration process. What has been also stressed is the significance of the amount and the mode in which radium parent isotopes occur in the environment for the genesis of radon, as well as the importance of half-life, especially that of 222Rn nuclide, for the possibility of its long-distance migration.\nThe description of radon geochemistry provided a&nbsp;basis for the presentation of the most important and the commonest applications of this element as a&nbsp;natural tracer of processes occurring in the lithosphere, hydrosphere and on the borders of these geospheres. Currently conducted research, aimed at getting more profound knowledge of radon geochemistry, will enable its far better and commoner application as a&nbsp;natural radioactive tracer of many processes occurring in the environment. It will also provide a&nbsp;basis for much more effective radiological protection, related to the most important property of this ubiquitous gas - its radioactivity, as well as enable more effective employment of its medicinal (though still disputed) effect on the human organism.",

            "abstract": "Food analysis is very important for the evaluation of the nutritional value and quality of fresh and processed products, and for monitoring food additives and other toxic contaminations.\nSample preparation such as extraction, concentration and isolation of analytes, greatly influences the reliable and accurate analysis of food. Currently there are some techniques of sample preparation such as SPE, SPME, MSPD, SFE, which have the following characteristic features:\nSolid-phase extraction (SPE) is a&nbsp;rapid and sensitive sample preparation technique, whose use has considerably increased within the last decade. This emerging technology has successfully replaced many tedious conventional methods of isolation and extraction of various chemicals in food (for example pesticide residues, tab. 1). Sample preparation and concentration via SPE can be achieved in a&nbsp;one-step extraction, and the methodology is appropriate for isolating trace amounts of chemical compounds from complex matrices such as food.\nSolid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a&nbsp;new sample preparation technique using a&nbsp;fused-silica fibre that is coated on the outside with an appropriate stationary phase [30,31]. This technique has been successfully applied in the analysis of pesticides in food (tab. 2).\nSupercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is sample preparation technique, which does not use organic solvents for trapping and for washing out of analytes. SFE usually with carbon dioxide and often with a&nbsp;modifier, is a&nbsp;rapid, selective and convenient method for sample clean-up in environmental analysis. In the past decade, SFE has been applied successfully to the extraction of a&nbsp;variety of organic compounds, e.g. pesticides from herbs [66], food [27] and agricultural samples [1]. Three inter-related factors influence analyte recovery in SFE: solubility in the fluid, diffusion through the matrix and adsorption in the matrix.\nMatrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD), a&nbsp;patented process for the simultaneous disruption and extraction of solid and semi-solid samples, was first reported in 1989 [72]. Since that time, MSPD has found application in numerous fields, but has proved to be particularly applicable for the analysis of drugs, pesticides and other components in food. MSPD enables complete fractionation of the sample matrix components as well as selective elution of a&nbsp;single compound or several classes of compounds from the same sample. The method has been applied to the isolation of pesticides from animal tissues, fruit, vegetables and other matrices (tab. 4).",

This handbook is devoted to full time (on-site) undergraduate and graduate students, but may also be used in a&nbsp;system of remote education of primarily teaching staff. The article describes successfully functioning systems of remote teaching in Poland and abroad and includes a&nbsp;discussion of their effectiveness.\nThe handbook Teaching of Environmental Protection differs from a&nbsp;conventional handbook in, among others, that each of its pages is not only illustrated by images or diagrams, but films, animations or simulations and includes the fact that all the functions of the learner and/or teacher are registered, which allows presentation, at the appropriate moment, of the appropriate assignment and/or test. The prepared system of hypertextual and hypermedial references simplifies searching out information and its compilation into various conceptual structures. Hence, this is an interactive handbook, with a&nbsp;branching, modular structure with broad potential for an uncomplicated expansion of its content.\nThe illustration of content prepared for the needs of the handbook are further discussed in the context of a&nbsp;choice of appropriate matters for effective visualization as well as programming tools necessary for this. An important element of this work was the preparation of basic methods of imaging by means of computer tools.\nConsidering the fundamental role played in chemical education by the experiment, the films included on the pages (windows) of the handbook were assigned to several modules, and then each of them was described with relation to the function that a&nbsp;given group of film sequences can play in the learning-teaching process.\nThe article presents the first results of the didactic work of teachers employing the modular system of remote teaching, making use of the handbook Teaching of Environmental Protection, and discusses them with relation to results obtained in the Department of Chemistry Didactics, during work with other multimedial products prepared there.",

The review deals with recent advances in synthesis of biodegradable polymers, and aliphatic polyesters in particular, via in vitro enzymatic catalysis. Recently, biodegradable aliphatic polyesters have attracted great interest in medicine as well as environmentally acceptable materials for packaging industry and agriculture. The enzyme-catalysed condensation reactions, ring-opening polymerisation, and corresponding transesterification of macromolecular substrates, as tools for their preparation, are discussed. Enzymes in polymer synthesis offer several advantages as substrate selectivity, enantio-, regio- and chemoselectivity. They enable, under mild reaction conditions and in the presence of or without organic solvents (in bulk), creation of useful polymeric materials with elimination of the potentially toxic catalysts. Some of functional polymers, difficult to obtain by conventional methodologies, may be synthesised using enzymes as catalysts. Although enzymatic procedures sometimes are not suitable for a&nbsp;large-scale preparation they can be successfully applied for new synthetic strategies for modelled polymers with desired topology and structure, including structure of the polymer end groups.",

            "abstract": "The condensation reaction of p-tert-butylphenol with formaldehyde leads in one step, with relatively high yield, to macrocyclic phenol-formaldehyde tetramer - calix[4]arene. This calixarene easily undergoes modification in the reaction with various substrates and a&nbsp;macrocyclic product functionalized at both 'narrow' and 'wide' rims can be prepared. According to this way, various calixarene derivatives exhibiting properties of selective complexation of various species can be obtained. The majority of applications of calix[4]arenes and their derivatives are focused on selective complexation of cations and anions.\nThe review demonstrates the possibility of syntheses of calixarenes with chromoionophoric properties. Usually, urea groups are used as anion binding receptors and chromogenic groups are introduced into the calixarene structure in close proximity to the ion-binding site.\nMethods of synthesis of chromoionophoric calixarenes able to complex selected anions were elaborated. In these calixarenes urea groups were connected to the calixarene ring in the reaction of an amine derivative with chromophoric isocyanate or active urethane. Several derivatives with naphthylurea and other chromophoric groups were prepared. The chemical structures of chromoionophoric calixarenes were confirmed by elemental analysis, as well as IR and proton NMR spectroscopies. It was found that calixarene ionophore with chromogenic urea groups show changes in the 1H NMR and phosphorescence spectra in the presence of nitrate, dihydrophosphate and hydrophosphate anions.\nChromogenic ditopic calixarene containing ester groups at the narrow and naphthylurea groups at the wide rim of calixarene was also described. The complexation of sodium ions by ester groups and dihydrophosphate anions by urea groups was confirmed via changes in the NMR spectra.\nThe method of obtaining and preliminary properties of the calixarene macromonomer, which possesses the ability of selective dihydrophosphate anions complexation, are also presented. The complexing properties of the macromonomer were very similar to that of the symmetric calixarene with four naphthyl urea groups at the wide rim. The resulting calixarene macromonomer containing chromophoric receptor groups (urea) and polymerizable group (allyl) is going to be covalently bonded with the polymer matrix by copolymerization with acrylic comonomers.",

However, in many applications the requirements of the tasks exceed the performance capabilities of classical fluids and the synthesis of new products to meet the extraordinary demands is necessary. Chemically and physiologically inert siloxanes, thermally stable poly(a-olefins) PAO and esters showing excellent resistance to nuclear radiation are some examples of synthetic oil. The fluids of ester structure, which are similar to natural triglicerydes, are very important class of synthetic oils. Ester oils possess superior physicochemical and performance properties as well as are non-toxic and easy biodegradable in comparison to many traditional derived fluids [21]. This paper is focused on specific application areas for which ester fluids are either currently used or being seriously considered for use. a&nbsp;special attention is given to ester oil synthesis including the methods based on indirect esterification, transesterification and enzymatic catalysis [11,12,49]. It is emphasised excellent thermo-oxidative properties of neopentyl alcohol esters [20]. Dicarboxylic acids esters, which are commonly used as synthetic fluids together with the compounds of oligomer, character are also discussed [37]. a&nbsp;new class of ester oils such as dialkyl carbonates and their synthesis using dimethyl carbonate as starting material are included [66]. Further sections of the paper are focused on phosphate esters and oils produced from native triglicerydes [76,95]. The effect of fatty acids structure on the properties of obtained products is reported. The methods of chemical modification of fatty acids structure such as selective hydrogenation, oligomerisation, alkylation, methatesis and acylooxylation are discussed. The last part of the paper deals with hydrolytic decomposition of esters in which steric hindrance and resonance effect play an important role [110].",

            "abstract": "Ion exclusion chromatography (IEC) is applied mostly to separate ionic compounds from the non-ionic ones. Wheaton and Bauman were first to describe this technique in 1953 [1]. At present about 10% of all ion chromatographic determinations are performed using IEC and this is approximately the number of determinations using the more common technique of ion pair (ion interaction) chromatography [2-6]. In the recent years the number of IEC determinations displays a&nbsp;strong tendency to increase.\nThe characteristic feature of IEC technique is the electric charge sign of dissociated ion-exchange resin functional groups that is the same as the electric charge sign of the analyzed ionic compound. It follows that samples of negatively charged ions e.g. dissociated acidic compounds are separated on cation exchange resins with anionic functional groups. Usually these are sulphonic acid groups. Similarly, samples containing positively charged species (bases) are separated on the anion exchange resin containing cationic functional groups. Usually these are tetraalkylammonium groups [2, 6]. In a&nbsp;sense these rules are in contrast to those of ion exchange chromatography, where anions are separated on anion exchange resins and cations are separated on cation exchange resins. However, the same columns can be used in both techniques. For the specific requirements of ion exclusion chromatography large ion exchange capacity is preferential [2, 9]. Along with these, to increase the capacity the column dimensions and the functional group concentration in the support are maximized. The usual supports are based on the macro-porous styrene and divinylbenzene copolymer.\nIEC finds application in the separation of a&nbsp;wide range of small, neutral or partially ionized molecules. In IEC the strong as well as weak electrolytes are eluted unseparated, the first at the beginning and the latter at the end of the elution. The retention volumes of the remaining electrolytes were found to be proportional to their dissociation constant values. The dead and inner volumes of the chromatographic column can be determined from the observed dependence of retention volumes onto dissociation constant values. The retention mechanism is described by the analytical equations and on the results obtained from the computer simulation of the column performance (using global thermodynamic and chromatographic equations or the Craig method). The mixed retention mechanism involving hydrophobic adsorption, p-electron interactions and screening effect is observed for weak electrolytes and aromatic compounds [8, 13, 14]. Aromatic compounds are retained almost solely involving interaction of the solute with the unfunctionalized regions of the stationary phase.\nThe purpose of this paper is to survey the field. The retention mechanism of analyzed compounds in ion-exclusion chromatography has been described. The influence of some physicochemical parameters describing the sample, the chromatographic column and the mobile phase on the retention is discussed. Finally, practical applications are briefly presented.",

Hertz at the end of XIX century investigated creation of the contact between two particles. He based his conclusion on mechanical side of phenomena only. This observation gave beginning for Griffith's testing, which elaborated theory of brittle fracture (1920). In this theory he coupled surface energy g and elasticity.\nAt the thirties Bradley and Derjaguin presented independently adhesion induced deformation. Bradley based his investigation on expotential relationship interaction between two molecules. Derjaguin interpreted these phenomena with the aid of geometrical and thermodynamical analysis.\nThe fifties there was a&nbsp;great development of trybology and fracture mechanics. Irwin introduced new technical term of strain energy G released when the crack area varied by dS. After that Krupp generalized Derjaguin model and added influence of plastic deformation.\nAt the early seventies two theories were created. First theory created by Johnson, Kendall and Roberts (called JKR), and second one by Derjaguin, Muller, Toporow (called DMT theory). These two models were and still are base to interpreting interparticle interactions.\nThe next model is Dugdale model developed for crack tip plasticity and is quite simple: the stresses in the cohesive zone are constant and equal to the yield stress of the testing material.\nIn 1983 Muller assuming a&nbsp;Hertzian profile, compared his earlier thermodynamic method, in which the force of attraction decreases from 2pWA to pWA, for more correct value by summing up the interactions in the Hertzian fixed gap.\nIn this publication range of application each of these theories are introduced.",

            "abstract": "Triterpenes are the group of natural compounds widespread in the plant kingdom [1]. They exhibit a&nbsp;range of biological activities. One of the most explored structures alike is betulin. This is a&nbsp;lupane type triterpene which is the main constituent of the extract of the white birch bark [2]. Betulin moiety is composed of four six- and one five membered rings with one isopropenyl and two hydroxyl groups (1) [2].\nBetulin and its derivatives show: antitumor [3-8], antiviral (HIV-1) [9, 10], antiinflammatory [12-13] and antiprotosoal [15] properties. The most promising, however, is antitumor activity. Betulinic acid - a&nbsp;product of the selective oxidation of betulin displays proapoptotic activity against several highly resistant tumor cells in vitro and in vivo [3-8]. Apoptosis i.e. cell-suicide is induced only in \"mutant\" cells and not in normal ones. EC50 (effective concentration causing death of 50% of the ill cells) of betulinic acid and its derivatives lie in the pM range [3, 4, 6, 7].\nIsolation, biogenesis and preparation of several modified betulin derivatives are reviewed in this article. Among the described reactions are: several routes of selective oxidation of betulin [3, 18, 23, 28-35, 38-48], dehydration [9, 35, 48-52], isomerisation [23, 38, 41-46], dehydrogenation [46-48], hydrogenation [53-55], glycosidation [59-61], esterification [28, 41, 42, 56, 57], preparation of amides (with the use of aminoacides) [5, 59] and synthesis of aminoderivatives [29, 58]. Some of these reactions give unexpected products [33, 43, 44].\nThe biological potency of these compounds may be due to their steroid-like structures (all-trans conformation and some more similarities). The exact mechanisms of the activities, however, remain unknown [3-8].\nThe ease of obtaining highly pure betulin and the potent biological activity of its derivatives can be the reason for singling out the compound as a&nbsp;lead, model triterpene for further chemical and biological investigations.",

            "abstract": "This review attempts to briefly summarise the recent developments in the synthesis and application of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives as biological active compounds. a&nbsp;large number of these compounds still evolves interest of chemists and pharmacologists. From among of one thousand papers, which appeared within the last fifteen years, most described applications of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives as biologicaly active compounds.\nNalidixic acid (1) was the first 1,8-naphthyridine derivative approved as the drug with antibacterial activity. There are many routes to the synthesis of nalidixic acid. The main routes are presented in the Schemes 1, 4, and 6. This compound was the first from the quinolone's family applied as the chemotherapeutic drug. Modification of the structure of nalidixic acid brought the discovery of a&nbsp;new group of most potent antibacterial compounds called fluoroquinolones. Enoxacine (16), esafloxacine (21), tosulfoxacine (22), trovafloxacine (23) and alatrofloxacine (24) are the examples of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives belonging to that group. General reaction scheme of synthesis of 16 and 21 is similar to synthesis of nalidixic acid (Scheme 7), while synthesis of the compounds 22, 23, and 24 presented in Scheme 8 is quite different. Moreover, many other 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives 31-40 have been intensively studied as antibacterial agents in vitro, but none of them has been applied as a&nbsp;drug.\nA number of 2- and 7-substituted 1,8-naphthyridines 41 showed some antimalarial activity in vivo [28], while the compounds of general structure 42 were found inactive [29].\n2(4)-Piperazinyl-1,8-naphthyridines (45) have been pharmacologically investigated for their antyhipertensive activity [33(35]. 1,8-Naphthyridines 46, bearing a&nbsp;phenyl group in position 2, were found to be selective antagonists for the A1 adenosine receptor subtype [36].\nA series of 1,8-naphthyridines 47-49 exhibited appreciable diuretic and antikaliuretic activity in rats [37(39].\nIn search for potential anticancer compounds study such as SAR (structure activity relationship) and QSAR (quantity structure activity relationship) have been used. As the result of the research the structure of the compounds 50 has established as the most potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. The nitrobenzo-1,8-naphthyridines (52) constitute a&nbsp;group of potential interest for the design of new cytotoxins [41].\nMoreover, 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives have been found to be active as inhibitors of platelet aggregation agents 53-54 [42,43]; antiviral 56-57 [45,46] and antialergic agents 62 [50,51]. These derivatives possess bronchodilating 64 [52,53], antiflammatory and sedative properties 67 [54-57].",

These subtypes have different tissue distributions with the ?1A receptors predominating in lower urinary tract tissue, whereas this receptor subtype is less prevalent in the vasculature [2 - 4]. In recent years, the search for new selective a1-AR antagonists has intensified, due to their importance in the treatment of hypertension and of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [5 - 7]. Tamsulosin, the first a1A-AR \"selective\" antagonists for the treatment of BPH, was approved in 1997 [9, 12]. a&nbsp;number of a1A subtype selective antagonists representing different structural classes of compounds were disclosed recently. These include: quinazolines [8 - 13], phenylalkylamines [9, 12, 14], piperidines [9, 15 - 23], arylpiperazines [24 - 36] and related compounds [37, 38]. a&nbsp;review on the development of a1 selective antagonists are presented.",

HIV integrase is one of the potential targets of anti-HIV drugs. Integrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of retrotranscribed viral DNA into the cellular host genome. Its structure is known [14] but until now there is no certified drug targeted at this enzyme. In the 90' several integrase inhibitors were described [18-28]. The investigations of these compounds allowed finding new active compounds, e.g., styrylchinolines that was described in recent years [29-32, 39]. In particular, the current publication discusses structure-activity relationships (SAR) for these compounds (Figure 1). It appeared that the SAR data from ex-vivo experiments [33] can be both visualized and interpreted by the use of the Kohonen maps of the electrostatic potetntial of the molecular surface [34-38] as shown in Figure 2. Finally, the results of the Merck investigations on HIV-1 integrase inhibitors have been briefly discussed (Figure 3) [38, 39].",

Both carbohydrates and their derivatives are involved in many biological processes, such as cell-cell recognition, cell growth and energy transfer. In spite of very high importance in living processes, carbohydrates remain one of the less exploited class of biologically active molecules.\nThere is a&nbsp;lot of different methods which can be used in carbohydrates analysis [1]. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most attractive, important and powerful tool for analyzing the conformation and molecular architecture of carbohydrate mole\u00adcules. This method serves the possibility of solving the majority of problems in this area, with\u00adout any different methods \u2013 particularly in the liquid phase. The biggest advantage of NMR spectroscopy is that it is a&nbsp;nondestructive method. Both one- and two-dimensional NMR methods have provided valuable information about small and large molecules, ranging from the anomeric configuration of a&nbsp;monosaccharide to the sequence of monosaccharide residues in a&nbsp;bigger oligo- or polysaccharide compounds. After first years of applications mainly in primary carbohydrate structures, NMR spectroscopy has recently reached a&nbsp;level of sophistication, which allows both the structural and conformational analysis of carbohydrates in solution. This article reviews the applications and possibilities of current NMR techniques to the structural and con\u00adformational characterization of carbohydrate and its derivatives. Both 1D and 2D (COSY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY, HMBC) NMR spectra of the GOTCAB saponin 1 are presented as examples of utilization of NMR in the structure elucidation of the carbohydrate derivatives.",

            "abstract": "The hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) methodology employing a,b-unsaturated thiocarbonyl compounds represents a&nbsp;straightforward and efficient approach to sulfur-containing six-membered heterocycles. This review presents applications of a,b-unsaturated thiocarbonyl compounds in heterodiene reactions and covers the literature published in the last two decades.\nThe a,b-unsaturated thiocarbonyl compounds, formally present 1-tia-1,3-butadiene system and include the following groups of compounds: thiochalcones, enaminothiones, a,b-unsaturated thioamides and compounds containing thiocarbonyl groups conjugated with carbon-carbon double bonds of carbo- and heteroaromatic rings. In general, reactions of 1-tia-1,3-butadiene systems with dienophiles belong to cycloadditions with normal electron demand, although there are some examples of cycloadditions with inverse electron demand.\nThe first chapter concerns the cycloadditions of thiochalcones. Most of them are synthesized from chalcones in reactions with Lawesson reagent. Thiochalcones are unstable, at room temperature they are in equilibrium with two dimeric forms: thiopyran and 3,4-dihydro-1,2-dithiin. Both compounds are formed by heterodiene cycloaddition of two molecules of thiochalcone. At higher temperatures the dimers undergo decomposition to thiochalcones. Thiochalcones generated in situ by heating the dimers were successfully used in cycloadditions to acryloamide, styrene and enol ethers well as in an asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder (AHDA) reactions with (-)\u00a0dimenthyl fumarate and in the reactions catalyzed by ytterbium triflate.\nThe next chapter deals with the reactions of enaminothiones. These compounds reacted smoothly with dienophiles containing electron withdrawing groups yielding cycloadducts in high yields. Some cycloadducts easily eliminated amine furnishing stable 2H-thiopyran derivatives. Reactions of enaminothiones with substituted b-nitrostyrenes proceeded in region- and stereoselective manner. In contrast to enaminothiones, a,b-unsaturated thioanilides were found to be less reactive in hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. Two molecules of thiocinnamamide underwent cycloaddition in acetyl chloride yielding N-acylated derivative of 3,4-dihydro-2H-thiopyran. N-acylated a,b-unsaturated thioanilides was successfully used in heterodiene reactions with N-phenylmaleimide, cyclopentene and enol ether. a&nbsp;recent applications of N-acylated a,b-unsaturated thioanilides deal with intramolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reactions leading to tricyclic thiopyran derivatives.\nThe compounds containing thiocarbonyl group conjugated with carbon-carbon double bond of furan or thiophene skeleton undergo cycloaddition with maleic anhydride, cyclopentene and norbornene yielding fused 2H-thiopyran derivatives in good yield. Some of the cycloadducts are unstable and spontaneously rearrange to aromatized compounds. An application of some organometallic reagents e.g. (Me2Al)2S in thionation of aromatic ketones extended their use to synthesis of various thiopyrans via hetero-Diels-Alder reactions.",

            "abstract": "Uronic acid are widely encountered in many important biopolymers of plant and animal origin in the form of glycosiduronic acids. Because degradation takes place during the hydrolises of the polymers only chemical synthesis can afford the great variety of pure oligosaccharides, needed to explore the structure-activity relationship or to mimic the biological properties of these domains. Due to a&nbsp;low reactivity of uronic acids towards glycosidation an alternative methods of synthesis of oligosaccharides containig uronic acid units are used.\nThe selective oxidation of carbohydrates derivatives has been intensively studied in the last decades and continues to be an area of timely interest. This holds especially for the conversion to uronic acid. Some common oxidation method for sugar hydroxymethyl group are collected in this brief review.\nPerhaps the most common transition metal in oxidation reagents is chromium. Chromic acid (Jones oxidation) is already so common that the classic version does not deserve any further comments. The development of milder version of the Jones oxidation began with the introduction of the Collins oxidation protocol. It has gained very wide use because of its simplicity (CrO3 is added into a&nbsp;dichloromethane solution of pyridine, and then the alcohol to be oxidized is added). Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a&nbsp;useful oxidant for the conversion of alcohols to carbonyls. The reagent is slightly acidic in character and the yields are usually better than with Collins oxidation. The use of aprotic solvents led to the development of pyridinium dichromate (PDC) as a&nbsp;neutral counterpart to the Collins oxidation. The advantages of this reagent include that only a&nbsp;small excess is needed (large excess of reagents makes large scale work difficult). Some examples of use of chromic oxidants in sugar chemistry are described in this paper.\nIn the oxidation of very sensitive molecules, the use of dimethyl sulfoxide together with a&nbsp;suitable electrophilic compound has proven to be very profitable. a&nbsp;synthetically important and often used method is the Swern oxidation, where DMSO is activated with oxalyl chloride. The reaction is performed at low temperature in dichloromethane solution. The low temperature is essential, since at higher temperature the DMSO-(COCl)2 complex decompose explosively. In order to tie up the HCl formed during the reaction and to liberate the alcohol complex, one commonly uses triethylamine as the base. The additional carbonyl group formed in the oxidation of sugar derivatives is particularly useful functionality in sugar synthesis. It can function as an electrophilic site or it can be induced to behave as a&nbsp;nucleophile. Its subsequent over-oxidation with NaClO2 leads to uronic acid. These aspects of use of Swern oxidation are described.\nRecently catalytic methods using stable organic nitroxyl radicals like 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl(piperidin-1-yloxyl) [TEMPO] as mediator have been developed. Reaction with TEMPO and its derivatives are of industrial interest. Substituted nitroxyl radicals are prepared in large amounts in high yield starting from the inexpensive basic chemicals. Additionally the mediator TEMPO can be easily recovered in quantitative yield after the oxidation of saccharides.",

This problem concentrate scientific interest of dietetics but also chemists and biologists. In the article actual knowledge on the natural and synthetic non-saccharide sweeteners is reviewed. The sweeteners presented here are divided, depending of their origins, on the compounds isolated from natural sources and compounds synthesized from simple organic precursors.\nOne of the most important groups of naturally devided sweeteners are peptides [6,7,11,15]. Some of them, particularly thaumatins find practical application as additives to a&nbsp;tooth-paste, food, drinks and drugs [5-7] The majority of intensely sweet naturally occurring compounds belong to the family of terpenoids comprise monoterpenoids [1,19,20], sesquiterpenoids [21] as well as di- and triterpenoids [20,23-25,29,30]. Their most prominent representatives such as perillartine, stevioside and glycyrrhizin are presented more detaily. Other groups of sweet tasting naturally occurring substances, mentioned in this paper are steroidal saponins [39,41], dihydroisocumarins [43,44], flavanoids and related compounds [47-49,51-53] and less common species such as haematoxylin [56,57], telosmosides [58] and monatin [59,60].\nThe second part of the article is devoted to synthetic sweeteners [1-3]. The well known representatives such as saccharin [61], cyclamates [62], Acesulfame-K [66], aspartame [1,2], alitame [71,72], neotame [73,74] and sucralose [65,75] are presented more detaily and methods of their synthesis are briefly reported.\nOrganoleptic properties of the most compounds are characterized and related to the molecular structure of sweetener is discussed.

            "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a&nbsp;natural biological mechanism for sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) homologous to a&nbsp;silenced gene. RNAi is found in a&nbsp;wide range of eukaryotes including human cells. The natural function of RNAi appears to be protection of a&nbsp;genome against invasion by mobile genetic elements such as transposons and viruses which produce aberrant RNA or dsRNA in a&nbsp;host cell. Specific mRNA degradation prevents transposon and virus replication. The majority of studies on the molecular mechanism underlying RNAi activity has been conducted in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans or in selected mammalian cell cultures. It has been demonstrated that long dsRNA is cleaved to 21\u201323 nucleotide long fragments by RNase III-like nuclease Dicer. These short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are essential sequence\u2013specific mediators of RNAi. They are bound by RNAi specific enzymes of nuclease complex RISC that targets mRNA for degradation. In this complex siRNA recognises, binds and cleaves the target mRNA. Cleavage occurs in the middle of the mRNA region recognized by the siRNA. The second model, which has been proposed for RNAi to explain the mechanism by which siRNA direct target mRNA destruction, requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to convert the target mRNA into dsRNA. RdRP is hypothesized to use antisense strand of siRNA as a&nbsp;primer in mRNA templated synthesis of complementary chain RNA. The resulting dsRNA is proposed to be cleaved then by Dicer for generation of secondary siRNA.\nShort interfering RNAs can be synthesized chemicaly or by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, or expressed from siRNA coding vectors in the cells. These 21-nt siRNA duplexes cause efficent inhibition of\u00a0exogenous and endogenous genes expression in a&nbsp;sequence-specific manner. Detailed analysis of potential modifications, that can be introduced into siRNA strands shows, that chemical modifications of sense strand are tolerated without loss of RNAi activity. However, some modification of antisense strand of siRNA (especially in the middle of the chain as well as modification of the 5\u2019end) completely abolish RNAi. These results indicate that two strands of siRNA have different function in RNAi. RNAi approach can be broadly used for analysis of gene functions, and, what is even more important, this phenomenon can be used for searching new agents for therapeutic applications.",

For most of the supports reviewed basic characteristics such as swelling in different solvents, solvent usability, typical loading, typical anchoring groups, preparation, and recent applications are given or cited. The reviewed literature suggests that the supports most often used for synthesis of small molecules and peptides are based on gel matrices. The variety of available supports, many of which were introduced in the last years, shows that this area of synthetic methodology may grow dynamically in the future.",

In solvent extraction and transport through liquid membranes, the derivatives of phosphoroorganic compounds and amines, as well as nonionic crown ethers were used as extractants and ion carriers. As collectors for foam separation the regular surfactants as well as ionizable lariat ethers were applied. It was found, that the main factor influencing the separation selectivity of zinc(II)/cadmium(II) was the diameter of cavity in the crown ether of applied macrocycles.

            "abstract": "Since the discovery of its marvellous insecticidal properties by Paul Mueller in 1939, DDT continues to stir human minds and to inspire countless scientists to study DDT effects on living creatures, from bacteria and insects to humans. There is probably no other chemical compounds which was studied as extensively and thoroughly as DDT and which provoked so many discussions and contradictory opinions. DDT was prized as the most useful compound which saved millions from unnecessary death due to malaria but was also condemned as a&nbsp;deadly poison threatening the life on Earth. It is important to know where is the truth.\nThis article was inspired by the fact that the voices of condemnation prevail in popular and scientific literature and, in the consequence, most people believe that DDT is harmful and its banning was prudent. However, the truth is quite different but it is deeply buried and difficult to find in the multitude of publications dealing with the biological properties of DDT. The problem is more difficult because of the fact that the oldest and most fundamental papers on biological activity of DDT are now forgotten and are never quoted in recent literature. My purpose is to remedy that situation by giving an unbiased picture of the good and bad sides of DDT such as emerges from a&nbsp;thorough search of the literature.\nIn this article i&nbsp;provide evidence that the ban of DDT was a&nbsp;very serious mistake and that DDT continues to serve the mankind in its fight against malaria, in disregard of all bans and condemnations. Nobody seems to remember now that after the ban in 1970s the temporary retreat from using DDT against mosquitoes killed several hundred million people which unnecessarily died of malaria. It appears that DDT ban stands out as the biggest homicidal act in all history of mankind. Responsibility is of course with politicians who voted for the ban and the scientists who advised them to do so.\nThere are still other reasons why it was necessary to write this article. My purpose is not to vindicate DDT but to expose the multitude of false opinions about that insecticide. Thus, it is not true that DDT is cancerogenic in humans or that its hormonal properties threaten our survival, as prophesized by authors of some recent books. It is also not true that DDT was ever a&nbsp;serious hazard for fish and wildlife. DDT never threatened hawks and eagles or pelicans and the countless papers which say otherwise are simply wrong.\nI provide plenty of published evidence in support of my efforts to rectify mistakes and deliberate lies which are so common in the literature on biological efffects of DDT. Unfortunately my litereature search revealed that in several cases the public was deliberately misled by scientists, who helped with their publications to spread false opinions about DDT. This provokes severe doubts concerning the integrity of ecologically minded scientists.",

Phosphonates and aminophosphonates are potent chelating agents for variety metal ions including the alkaline earth ions, the divalent ions as well as the trivalent ions.\nIn this article we are summarizing and discussing the acid-base properties and the metal ion-coordinating properties of compounds involving one, two or more phosphonic groups. This work is aimed at being brief indicating the main achievements in researches over coordination preferences of this group of ligands.\nThe present considerations are restricted to complexes in solution, involving the alkaline earth ions and the divalent ions of the second half of the 3d series as well as Zn2+ and Cd2+.\nThe acid-base properties of the considered ligands depend on many factors such as the number of phosphonic groups in one molecule, the presence of other functional groups (e.g. COOH, NH3+, OH), the distance between functional groups and electronic effects of the substituents.\nThese ligands contain a&nbsp;range of potential donor atoms. As a&nbsp;result, various bonding modes for a&nbsp;given chelating ligand are involved, and are reviewed with reference to ligand structure and the resulting coordination complexes. It is shown that depending on the pH and the nature of the metal ion in solution these ligands can bind to a&nbsp;metal ion via oxygen(s) (mostly with alkaline earth ions), and in a&nbsp;N,O bonding mode (usually with d metals).\nCoordination properties of phosphonic and aminophosphonic acids are important factors to understand the role of the ligands and metal ions in biological systems.",

Two next parts present the way of determination of their chemical formula and methods of their synthesis.\nThe described physical properties concern the electrical resistivity, superconductivity, magnetism, and some spectral properties. On this basis possible band structures are presented. Particular attention is devoted to the similarities and differences of the physical properties between parent compounds LnX, TX2 and the misfits (LnX)1+n (TX2)m.

            "abstract": "The agrochemical industry is continuously searching for new active compounds to combat pests. The main aim of this research is to develop new substances with lower application rates, increased selectivity and decreased undesired ecological impact. Most synthetic agrochemicals with chiral structure are marketed as racemates even though the desired biological activity may be derived from only one enantiopure isomer. However, some newly introduced compounds are marketed as the most biologically active stereoisomers. When agrochemicals have chiral structures, efforts should be made to define the mode of action, toxicity, and metabolic pathway of each enantiopure isomer. If there are large differences in the biological activities of individual stereoisomers, it is desirable to use only the most active one. In this review article some stereochemical aspects of several groups of important agrochemicals including aryloxypropanoate herbicides (Fig. 1), acylanilides (Fig. 2), triazine herbicides, ureas and cyanoacrylates (Fig. 3), triazole fungicides (Fig. 4), morpholine derivatives (Fig. 5), organochlorine insecticides (Fig. 6), pyrethroid insecticides (Fig. 7 and 8), pheromones and antifeedants (Fig. 9), and organophosphorus compounds (Fig. 10), will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "At the present time tuberculosis is completely treatable. However, it[MS1] is still a&nbsp;major cause of morbidity and mortality among the poorest people. Tuberculosis is the main source of death from among infectious diseases worldwide. In turn, infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death in the world today, greater than cardiovascular disease or cancer. According to the data provided by World Health Organization (WHO), one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In contrary to general expectation, the incidence of mycobacterial disease has significantly increased since 1990 worldwide. This problem has been aggravated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemia and the recent increase in incidences of microbial resistance to antibiotics. Another problem is the lack of the viable research program to develop the new range of the antituberculosis drugs. Since the mid 90\u2019s no new drugs have been introduced, with the exception of a&nbsp;few minor modifications of existing formulas.\nThis review presents history and current summary of the developments in the application and synthesis of tuberculostatic chemotherapeutics. One of the first type of drugs used were salts of heavy metals, which were discontinued quickly due to the high degree of their toxicity. However pirazinamide(2), introduced in 1936 is still being used today. Modern antituberculosis therapies started in 1944 with the Waksman\u2019s discovery of the streptomycin (12). From among modern drugs the most popular are: PAS (15), INH (18), and EMB (34). Schemes 7, 8 and 14, 15 show the methods of synthesis of these compounds. Similarly, schemes 9?11 show the same for the cycloserine (22) antibiotic, and figures 2, 3 and 4 present the structures of the kanamycin 33 cyclic polipeptide 38 and ansamycin 39 antibiotics. Furthermore, detailed description of the methods of synthesis of fluorochinolones 44, 45 and 46 (introduced in 80\u2019s) can be found in schemes 19, 20 and 22. In this article there is also information about the direction of the new research trends taking place in the field of the new antituberculosis agents.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a&nbsp;powerful analytical technique which uses an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source and mass spectrometric (MS) detector with a&nbsp;time of flight (TOF) analyzer. The technique has been introduced in 1993 and has attracted rapidly the attention of researchers in the field of atomic spectroscopy as a&nbsp;method that offers substantial improvement of figures of merit of widely used ICP-MS technique with quadrupole filters [42-46].\nA mass spectrum in ICP-TOFMS technique is generated for a&nbsp;packet of ions simultaneously extracted from a&nbsp;continuous ion beam generated in plasma and accelerated to the same kinetic energy (Ek = 0.5 mv2) (Fig. 3). Setting the ions to the same kinetic energy results in different velocities acquired by the ions of different masses. The separation of the ions of different m/z is accomplished due to different times of their passing a&nbsp;fixed path (field-free region) in the instrument (Fig. 6 and 8). Extremely low time difference (nanosecond regime) between adjacent masses reflects in quasi-simultaneous detection of all isotopes reaching the detector.\nThe technique offers extremely high speed: spectral frequency 20-30 kHz (i.e. 20000-30000 mass spectra can be accumulated per second), an ability to obtain full elemental analysis for a&nbsp;packet of ions extracted from a&nbsp;continuous ion beam and a&nbsp;significantly better, as compared with quadrupole ICP-MS, precision of the measurements [53, 56, 57, 79].\nAnalytical performance and applicability of the technique in multi-clemental analysis of various materials have been extensively examined since 1998 when the ICP-TOFMS spectrometers have been commercially available (from LECO, USA (\u201eLECO Renaissance\") and GBC, Australia (\u201eOptimass 8000\")). The technique has turned to be particularly suited for detection of fast transient signals generated, e.g. by laser ablation [59-63], chromatographic systems [64-71], capillary clectrophoresis [69, 72] and FIA [73-77].\nThe basic principles, analytical capabilities of the ICP-TOFMS technique and characteristics of the instruments used are discussed in this paper. Analytical applications of the technique are presented.",

He noted, \u201cIn the course of some experiments on dialyzation, my assistant, Mr. C.W. Eberlein, called my attention to the fact that a&nbsp;liquid in a&nbsp;collodion bag, which was suspended in the air, evaporated, although the bag was tightly closed. At first we were inclined to ascribe it to evaporation through a&nbsp;small aperture at the top of the bag, but further experiments and especially the speed of evaporation soon forced us to the conclusion that the aqueous vapour is given off through the membrane, as though the water were suspended as a&nbsp;solid without any membrane present. This phenomenon we have named pervaporation.\u201d\nUsually, we think about membrane like about strainer, which holds bigger participle, and passes the smaller one. But in pervaporation process, we use smooth, non-porous membranes without \u201choles\u201d. The clue of pervaporation phenomena is that this technique is based on a&nbsp;solution-diffusion mechanism combined with a&nbsp;phase change from liquid phase on feed membrane side to gas phase on permeate membrane side. Therefore it can be used to solve separation problems encountered with traditional, equilibrium-based, separation techniques. The driving force in pervaporation is a&nbsp;difference in chemical potential between feed and permeate side. The separation is achieved by different mass transfer rates of the components through the membrane. Generally, the mass transfer of the permeants in pervaporation process can be distinguished by the three different steps [2, 3, 4, 5]: 1. selective absorption on membrane surface at the feed side, 2. selective diffusion through the membrane (in some cases this effect is con-nected with molecular solvatation of the permeants in membrane volume), 3. desorption into the vapour permeate on the permeate side.\nNowadays, among the various membrane processes, pervaporation is considered as one of the most promising processes for many industrial applications from dehydration of alcohols to recover organic compounds from wastewater [6]. Other applications of the pervaporation technology such as separation of organics mixtures and breaking azeotropes have also made progress.",

Molecules of the gas are produced by a&nbsp;single cell and transmitted via cellular membranes into another cell where they regulate its function. This is an entirely new mechanism of signal transmission in biological systems.\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the production of nitric oxide from L-arginine is a&nbsp;common biochemical pathway controlling the activity of guanyl cyclase. Isomorphic forms of nitric oxide synthase play a&nbsp;role in the regulation of blood vessels tone, blood flow, activity of platelets, gastrointestinal tract motor activity and reactivity of the respiratory tract. Nitric oxide produced by inducible form of synthase plays a&nbsp;significant role in immunological response and pathophysiological changes present in inflammatory reactions and shock. Nitric oxide is also produced in neurones of the central and peripheral nervous system.\nCurrently drugs which could activate of inhibit biochemical reactions concerning the release of nitric oxide are being investigated. With these drugs, the role of the system arginine?nitric oxide in physiological and pathological conditions could be explained. We are looking for donors of nitric oxide in various classes of chemical compounds. The research concentrates mainly on the following: O-nitro- and O-nitroso- compounds, S-nitro- and S-nitrosocompounds and N-nitro- and N-nitrosocompounds, C-nitro- and C-nitrosocompounds, oximes, heterocyclic NO donor compounds, nitroxyl (HNO/NO-) generating compounds, hydroxylamine, N-hydroxyguanidines, inorganic NO donors and transition metal nitrosyls.\nThe tested groups of compounds affect the production of exogenous nitrous oxide or stimulate its endogenous production to various degrees. In the course of conducted studies new applications for well-known drugs appear, and numerous new compounds await registration. One may expect many novel therapeutic options based on nitric oxide.\nThis study has been based on Methods in nitric oxide research [1] and current bibliography. In this part of study we present NO donors form the groups: O-nitro- and O-nitrosocompounds, S-nitro- and S-nitrosocompounds and N-nitro- and N-nitrosocompounds.",

The above mentioned properties of these novel synthetic structures will result not only from the presence therein of the various required elements, but also from their relative arrangements in space and the three-dimensional shape of the overall assembly. In other words, spatially separated elements combine to achieve an overall effect in these structures. Hence, there will be a&nbsp;requirement for molecules with well-defined geometries in which conformational freedom is kept under close control. This criterion can be met by designs based on rigid frameworks. The steroid nucleus is one of the largest rigid units which is readily available. There are many steroidal compounds which might be chosen as starting materials for more elaborate frameworks. However, bile acids are the most valuable group of these compounds due to their chemically different hydroxyl groups, enantiomeric purity, unique amphiphilicity, availability and low cost.\nBile acids are natural polyhydroxylated steroidal acids existing in bile as sodium salts of N-acyl derivatives of glycine and taurine. They are synthesized from cholesterol and can solubilize hydrophobic substances by the formation of micellar aggregates and thus help in the digestion of fat lipids.\nIn this review applications of bile acids as building blocks in the synthesis of macrocyclic and also open-chained supramolecular hosts are presented.",

The popularity comes from its low price along with easiness of removal by distillation. However, Et3N is a&nbsp;very dangerous fire hazard when exposed to the heat, flame, or oxidizers. Their salts with inorganic acids are somewhat insoluble in most organic solvents of low polarity and for that reason may by removed from the reaction media by simple filtration.\nExamples of application of Et3N in oxidation reactions are shown in ozonolysis of cycloalkene 1-8 [3-5] (figs 1-4-5), and figs 1-6-8 show oxidation of 1-14, 1-16, and 1-18 alcohols, employing activated DMSO [6-12]. Various oxidation processes of hydrazones with iodide in the presence of Et3N are presented in fig. 1-9 [13]. Elimination reactions, concerned mainly with dehydrohalogenations, are described in examples of halogen derivatives of lactone 2-1 [17], ketone 2-3 [18,19], sulfone 2-6 [20], and acids 2-9 and 2-11 [21,22] (figs 2-1-5). Dehalogenation of 2-13 [23], 2-17 [26-28], and 2-22 [31-37] acid chlorides are presented in figs 2-6-8, while formation of nitrile oxides in figs 2-11-13 [38-42]. Competitive dehydrobromination and dehydrochlorination reaction occurs in the presence of Et3N in 1,1,1-trichloro-3-bromo-3-fenylopropane (2-35) is described in fig. 2-15 [44]. Mechanizm and examples of transformation of chlorosulfonyl chlorides are presented in figs 2-17-20 [47-51], and dimerization of aldiminium salts [63] in fig. 2-25 as well. Applications of Et3N in carbon-carbon bond formation in an intramolecular Heck reaction are shown in fig. 3-1 [70-74]. Example of use of Et3N in enolboronation of carbonyl compounds is described in fig. 3-2 [75-78], and additionally, in synthesis of silyl enol ethers can be found in figs 3-3-6 [89-104]. Application of Et3N as the base in neutralizing the acids liberated in preparing diazo ketones and mixed anhydrides are indicated in fig. 3-7 [105-107] and fig. 3-8 [108-117] respectively, while in protecting of hydroxy group in figs 3-9-11 [118-126]. Use of Et3N as the effective catalyst in cyjanoethylation reaction of active methyl group in acetylacetone (4-2) [130] and alkylpyridine methiodides 4-4-5, 4-8-9 [131] are shown in figs 4-1-3, and in isomerization reaction of pyrazolines 4-14 [133] and cycloaddition of indane-1,3-dione (4-16) [134] in figs.4-5?6.",

            "abstract": "The paper presents perspectives of development and application of determinations of arsenic, antimony and selenium by the methods based on hydride generation [1,2, 4-17]. This technique employed in spectrometric methods: absorption atomic spectrometry (AAS), atomic fluorescence (AFS), microwave (MIP) or inductively excited plasma (ICP) with emission or mass detection has become a&nbsp;very important tool in determination of environmental samples [3, 18]. The paper presents the possibilities of current analytical methods available with the use of this technique. First of all the detection limit can be decreased by in-situ preconcentration of volatile hydrides on the cell walls [19-36]. The possibility of speciation determinations based on the differences in the kinetics of hydride generation by different species present in the sample is discussed [79]. Speciation analysis brings important information on the real toxicity of migration pathways of the element studied [37-78]. The need for this kind of information has stimulated development of new analytical solutions allowing separation of species in the chromatographic system or capillary electrophoresis, with selective spectrometric methods ICPMS, AAS or AFS in combination with hydride generation used for detection [79-115]. The progress in the hydride generation technique is closely related with recent attempts at direct analyses of solid samples [120-123], without the need to convert them into liquids, which facilitates the analytical process and permits simultaneous or almost simultaneous determination of many elements [124-126].",

            "abstract": "The paper presents a&nbsp;review of spectrophotometric methods for determination of nitrates (III), (V) and nitric oxides [1\u201348] with particular emphasis on the possibilities of the Griess\u2013Ilosvay method. The original method [50, 51] developed for determination of nitrates (III) and based on derivatisation of these compounds to nitrogen dyes has undergone many modifications over the decades. The aim of the modifications was to enhance the method\u2019s sensitivity, decrease the level of determination, simplify the procedure and its adjustment to achieve the most effective determination also in the presence of a&nbsp;complex matrix [52\u201367]. The increasing demands of analytical chemistry and the need to determine trace or ultratrace amounts of nitrates have prompted further improvement of the Griess\u2013Ilosvay method by combining it with methods of analyte enrichment such as liquid\u2013liquid\u2013extraction [68\u201380] and liquid\u2013solid extraction [81\u201394]. The recent need for routine determinations in the monitoring of the natural environment has led to the development of the fast flow\u2013through \u2013 injection methods [95\u2013127], making the analytical process more effective and convenient to use. One of the most recent achievements in analytical chemistry of nitrates (III) and (V) has been the development of optical sensors (optrodes) [128\u2013132]. They are used in modified versions of the Griess\u2013Ilosvay method and permit a&nbsp;direct and relatively easy determination of the contents of nitrates preserving a&nbsp;high sensitivity of the method. The paper gives a&nbsp;comparative review of the modifications of the Griess\u2013Ilosvay method from the earliest to the most recent",

            "abstract": "Rapid development of different electronic devices was initiated by the discovery of semiconductor-based switch - a&nbsp;transistor in 1948 by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain and W.B. Shockley. All electronic devices are based on semiconductor components ever since. Growing demand for bigger memorics and faster processors requires smaller and smaller transistors and other componcnts. Soon the integration scale of elcctronic components will reach the physical limits and further speeding up will not be possible. The only solution of the crisis is application of single molecules and molecular systems for data acquisition, storage, transfer and processing.\nThere are numerous chemical systems capable of performing logical operations, some of them have already found practical applications. Carbon nanotubes, semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots), organic polymers and other supramolecular assemblies can be a&nbsp;basis for construction of chemical switches and logic gates. These devices, however, are chemical versions of traditional semiconductor devices, as the operational principles are imported directly from solid state electronics.\nThis paper deals with several different approaches towards chemical computing. a&nbsp;large variety of other chemical systems can be used for computing purposes. Some of them are extremely complex (like Aviram-Ratner type devices) and require advanced organic syntheses, other are very simple, like organic dyes and simple transition metal cornplexes. Despite substantial difference in chemical structure, the reactivity of these systems can be described using common language: the Boolean logic.\nAny chemical system, which exists in at least two different forms of different optical or electrochemical properties and can be switched with some chemical or physical stimuli (light, redox potential, pH, specific substrate) can be treated as a&nbsp;molecular switch. If the logic structure of the switch is more complex (i.c. there are several different states or several switching stimuli) the system forms a&nbsp;logic gate. The principles of operation of chemical logic gates are identical with those of clectronic logic gates. The input and output signals may have only two values: 0 (OFF, FALSE) or 1 (ON, TRUE). Output signal is a&nbsp;Boolean function of input signals. The basic logic gates are: YES, NOT, OR, NOR, AND, NAND, EX-OR and EX-NOR.\nEven the simplest molecular system can exhibit complex logic behaviour, it depends mostly on specific chemical reactivity of the system, proper assignment of the input and output parametcrs and imagination of the experimenter. Some systems are complex enough to emulate not only single gates, but also much larger computing circuits of multilayer parallel architecture. At the same time these systems are closely related to quantum computers: they can be considered as supetposition of different logic gates. Although many of these systems are very impractical, they are guidelines leading to new powerful technologies.",

            "abstract": "The supramolecular chemistry is one of the most intensely developed fields of contemporary chemistry. Supramolecular chemistry may be defined as \"chemistry beyond the molccule\", bearing on the organized entities of higher complexity that result from association of two or more chemical species hold together by intermolecular forces [1]. Self-assembly involves the direct and spontaneous formation of a&nbsp;closed superstructure or polymer from a&nbsp;mixture of components (organic ligands, salts crystals, and sometimes molecules of solvents). The product exhibits a&nbsp;notable thermodynamic and kinetic stability and its components should contain all the information necessary for a&nbsp;correct assembly to occur. Self-assembly has recently been achieved in many types of organic and inorganic systems [2-I 1]. The inorganic self-assembly involves spontaneous generation of well-defined metallo-supramolecular architectures from mixtures of organic ligands and metal ions. This latter approach has proven particularly successful for the generation of a&nbsp;wide spectrum of architectural topologies such as for example, inorganic double [12-15], triple [16-20] and quadruple [21] helicates [22-25], rotaxanes [26-29], clusters [30-35], racks [36, 37], ladders [38, 39], cages [40-47], wheels [48, 49], grids [50-90] etc., based on ligand design and the application of suitable coordination geometries for the assembling system. Among them, there is an increasing interest in grid-type complexes, based on ligands containing oligopyridine type of sites and a&nbsp;various d-metal ions. The grids are the thermodynamically most stable motif when metal ions of octahedral coordination geometry are combined with a&nbsp;planar ligand containing tridentate binding sites. Such compounds may exhibit novel physical and chemical properties with interesting and useful potential applications in supramolecular engineering, nanotechnology, biomedical inorganic chemistry, biological catalysis, and in the area of sensors. Transistors incorporating complexes containing cobalt ion bonded to polypyridyl ligands have been reported recently, which is expected to be important in molecular electronics and in the study of the physics of nanoscale systems [91] The structure of grid-type complexes depends strongly on the ligand substituent, the ligand conformation, the metal ion, the counterion, the solvent, and the reaction conditions.\nThe paper has been prepared on the basis of literature in the field and results of my own studies. The main contribution is a&nbsp;deseription of synthesis and characterization of the grid-type complexes, taking into regard their untypical properties and structure.",

            "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) belong to the family of POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) which WHO (World Health Organization), EPA (Environment Protection Agency) and other prestigious institutions pronounced to be a&nbsp;very serious health hazard to humans and animals. It appears, however, that this pronouncement is without solid support in published scientific papers.\nPCBs were commercially produced since 1929 for use in electrical capacitors and transformers. It is estimated that a&nbsp;total of 1.5 million tons were made until the production was terminated worldwide in late 1970s. About one half of the produced amount is contained in electrical equipments which are still in use while the other half entered the environment.\nThe presence of detectable concentrations of PCBs and their persistence in air, water and in living organisms raised concerns that human and animal health may be adversely affected. Health considerations stimulated a&nbsp;very intense research activity which continues unabated from 1966 with the objective of finding evidence of harmful properties of PCBs. Such evidence has not been found yet apart from some minor effects which are without serious consequences.\nPCBs appear to be quite harmless chemicals even when handled without proper care. This is evident from the fact that there was no single human death although several cases of poisoning by PCBs were reported. The most publicized are the accidents in Japan and Taiwan which affected about 3000 victims. However, the most serious effects were reversible dermal lesions. The most recent case of accidental poisoning occured in Belgium in 1999. The brouhaha in media was enormous although no human health effects were evident.\nThe case of PCBs is just another example of chemophobia instigated by irresponsible enviromentalists.\nThe three decades of PCB research resulted in enormous improvements in the analysis of trace contaminants. It is now possible to detect and quantitate each of the over one hundred PCB congeners present at concentrations in the ppb range. There are 209 PCB congeners with different numbers and positions of chlorine atoms.\nThis article is based on a&nbsp;thorough search of the literature from late 1960th to the present. Unfortunately it was impossible to read all papers on PCBs in the environment because over three hundred articles are published every year. We took care, however, to learn and present the views of scientists who firmly believe that PCBs are very harmful as well as of those who do not think so. We were able to discover some very drastic examples of papers with unfounded conclusions.",

Further egzo- and endohedral functionalization of fullerenes resulted in a&nbsp;new class of compounds and heterofullerenes were also produced by substitution of carbon atoms in a&nbsp;cage by other (mostly boron and nitrogen) atoms. Recently new intriguing forms of nanocarbous have been also discovered including carbon onions, encapsulates, filled nanotubes, `peapods', etc. In this review these nanocarbons are presented with the emphasis on production techniques and formation mechanisms, structure characterization and the future fields of application. While carbon are, laser ablation and CCVD (Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition) are the main techniques to produce these species, they are also formed under quite ditferent experimental conditions which are presented.

            "abstract": "One of the main goals of supramolecular chemistry is to use bowl-shaped molecules to recognize a&nbsp;substrate on the basis of size, shape, functionality and electrostatic profile. Design and investigation of molecules which are capable to form well defined, functional supramolecular structures has attracted considerable interest during the last three decades. This concept was borrowed from biological systems where the process of molecular recognition is central to the chemistry of life.\nAmong the molecules possessing the suitable shape and properties, there is a&nbsp;class of polycyclic mocromolecules-the resorcarenes. They have the cavities, whose geometries depend on the molecular structure, and the walls of these cavities contain active sites, which serve for the substrate binding. Availability of many active sites makes such a&nbsp;molecule a&nbsp;suitable platform for the synthesis of many new types of resorcarenes.\nThe synthesis of compounds of type l, derived from resorcinol and aldehydes, has already been described very carly but the structures of such a&nbsp;compound were confirmed by Erdtman et. al. in 1968 by crystallographic analysis [5-8]. The non-planar structure of resorcarenes makes it possible for them to exist in several different conformations. Resorcarenes can be prepared in high yield in a&nbsp;one-step procedure with neither template nor high dilution effects. In most cases, the mineral acids are applied as the catalysts for condensation of polyhydroxyphenols (i.e. pyrogallol or resorcinol) or the derivatives thereof with aldehydes [ 11-13]. However, preparations of these macrocycles making use of Lewis acids [ 14-19] or bases [20] as catalysts are known also. The effective method of controlling the spatial structure and physico-chemical properties of resorcarenes consists in: modification of the aldehyde type used, introduction of the substituent ortho to the hydroxy groups, and functionalization of the OH groups. The electrophilic substituents such as bromo or diazo group can be readily introduced at the ortho position [24, 25]. However, the most freduently employed electrophilic substitution in resorcarenes in the Mannich reaction [26-33]. Depending on the type and amounts of the reactants, one can obtain the aminomethyl [24, 30], oxazine [26] or oxazolidine [27] derivatives. In turn, the hydroxy groups of resorcarenes can be functionalized in several ways, by:\nThe last of the above approaches leads to the synthesis of cavitands which are in turn employed in the synthesis of the double resorcarenes, named carcerands and carcaplexes [66-88].\nThe presented paper is a&nbsp;continuation of work published in Wiadomo\u015bci Chemiczne in 1997. Now, we present the development of methods for the synthesis of different derivatives of resorcarenes described in literature till now. The second part will concetrate on complexation properties of resorcarenes and the third part on their applications.",

            "abstract": "Although the majority of enzymatic hydroxylation reactions is catalysed by monooxygenases [1], dehydrogenases also play an important role in many reactions of this type. For example, dehydrogenases take part in hydroxylation of alifatic acids or nicotinic acid and its analogues [2]. These reactions are important for degradation, biosynthesis and metabolism processes. Also, enzymic hydroxylation has been succesfully applied to the synthesis of L-carnitine, which is pharmacologically important compound. Another synthetic application involves enantioselective hydroxylation of isobutyric acid, where the proper catalyst species selection may lead to each enantiomer of the product selectively. Both enantiomers of b-hydroxyisobutyric acid are known as valuable chiral synthons for synthesis of many biologically active compounds, i.e. drugs, vitamins and others. The mechanism of alifatic compounds hydroxylation is well known - all the steps have been well documented. The reaction described were carried out by means of induced enzymes.\nThe proof of dehydrogenases mediation in hydroxylation of N-heterocyclic substrates is the fact, that the oxygen in hydroxyl group derives from water, not from the air.\nSome of these reactions proceed quantitatively, affording very clean products. The reaction that found practical application of considerable importance is the hydroxylation of nicotinic acid (being precursor of a&nbsp;new generation insccticide) and its analogues.\nIt is highly probable that the microbial hydroxylation of this type can find application in transformations of so called \"enewable resource\" (i.e. nicotine) in order to obtain important biologically active products.",

            "abstract": "Derivatization is a&nbsp;modern method used in both organic and inorganic analytical chemistry. Application of derivatization to determine trace quantity of compounds requires very sensitive detection techniques. That combined with separation of analyzed compounds, makes the chromatographic systems like GC (gas chromatography) and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) especially useful in the analysis [1-2].\nThere are mainly three routes in trace analysis of derivatized compounds [3]. One can obtain derivative before performing a&nbsp;column separation (pre-column technique), which can be done both inside or outside chromatographic apparatus, or after column separation (post-column technique). The third method is based on dcrivatization reaction taking place simultaneously with column separation and requires special column filling which is resistant to derivatization reagents.\nThere are several methods used to obtain derivatized compounds suitable for chromatographic methods [4-6]. Acylation adapted to determine traces of amphetamine, methamphetamine and their metabolites allows lowering the detection level to 1 ppb [7]. Very important part of derivatization methods in trace analysis is a&nbsp;determination of heavy metals via sodium tetraalkylborate alkylation with AED detection (atomic emission detection). Organometallic traces can be derivatized with tetraborate salts with AAD detection (atomic absorption detection) [8]. Less known methods like condensation and esterification are also very useful with suitable detector. For example, determination of ketones and aldehydes via derivatization with pentafluorophenylhydrazine allows to lower detection level down to 10-'4 mol [11]. Esterification of fatty acids with 9-(2-hydroxyethyl)carbazole performed on HPLC column gives full separation of esters with detection limit being around 45 fmol [14].",

            "abstract": "In the last few years solid-phase extraction (SPE) has become the most often used preconcentration technique for trace analysis. In SPE with most commercial sorbents, many components of complex samples are co-extracted, so additional clean-up is usually needed before the chromatographic analysis is made. However, specific SPE materials avoid this problem by providing a&nbsp;selective extraction. So far, the most selective phases used for SPE are based on immunoaffinity (IAC). The high selectivity and low stability of immunosorbents and the fact that is difficult and expensive to obtain biological antibodies are reason that IACs are used less widely for many different compounds [56, 57]. An alternative technology, using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), is currently being extensively evaluated. Table 1 compares characteristics of molecularly imprinted polymer, immunoaffinity and conventional SPE columns.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, MIPs are made in situ by copolymerization of functional monomeres and crosslinking monomeres in the presence of the print molecule, called the template that after extraction leaves its molecular impression on the surface as the polymer forms around it [39, 30]. The examples of most commonly used monomers are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.\nTable 2 provides an overview of examples of applications of SPE that incorporate molecularly imprinted polymer technology for extracting drugs and pollutants from different matrices.\nBesides SPE, MIPs have been applied as selective sorbents in several analytical techniques, including liquid chromatography [12-18], capillary electrophoresis, electrochromatography [19-23], as immunoassay and sensors [24-28].",

            "abstract": "Dioxins as a&nbsp;class of chemical compounds were defined with consideration of their biological properties rather than structure of molecules. Their structures are quite diverse and include all chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans as well as some chlorinated biphenyls. The common feature of several (but not all) dioxins is their pronounced toxicity to animals. The best known and most toxic is the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, simply referred to as dioxin or TCDD.\nDioxins are produced by virtually all industrial processes involving organic matter and chlorine at elevated temperatures. In the past the incineration of communal wastes was a&nbsp;particularly important source of dioxin but gases emitted by modern waste incinerators do contain less TCDD than ambient air.\nFor many years it was believed that dioxins are man-made compounds without natural sources but that belief was disproved by the discovery of TCDD in forty million years old clay deposits. Evidence is mounting that forest fires and burning of coal, wood and peat in domestic hearths are the most important sources of dioxins. a&nbsp;dioxin-free world is not possible because man has little control over forest fires and there is no way to curtail the burning of dioxin-producing fuels in homes, partricularly in poor countries.\nDioxins are in our bodies and around us. The fat of humans not exposed to large concentrations of dioxins contains TCDD at concentrations of several pg/g. The dioxin levels in the air are at the level of several pg/m3. Concentrations larger by orders of magnitude are in soils around the world and in sediments and sewage sludges.\nDioxins in human bodies are derived from the food we eat. The concentrations in food vary within wide limits, from less than 1 pg/g in vegetables to more than 100 pg/g in some fishes. There are scientists who express grave concern over possible harmful effects of dioxins in food but scientific evidence demostrates that such concerns are totally unfounded. After all the dioxins were on our planet since the beginning of mankind and even before and nobody was ever able to provide evidence of their harmfulness. On the contrary, there are many examples of highly exposed industrial workers who suffered no adverse effects although their blood contained several hundred times more dioxins than the blood of the general population.\nIt is commonly believed that TCDD is the most toxic man-made compound, is highly carcinogenic and presents a&nbsp;very serious risk to human health. These are unfounded beliefs without any support by scientific evidence. The only demonstrated dioxin-related human disease is chloracne, a&nbsp;skin disease associated with heavy exposure to TCDD. In some cases chloracne persists for one or two years but never threatens the life of victims. Medicine knows of no case of human death due to dioxins. This simple fact strongly contradicts the belief that dioxins are deadly poisonous to humans.",

Most of the chemical studies have been done using this isotope. Astatine is one of the most difficult clements to study from a&nbsp;chemical point of view, and our knowledge of its compounds is rather incomplete compared to what we know about other elements. For this there are several reasons, especially that the astatine have very short-lived isotopes which make it impractical to obtain weighable amounts of the element. Therefore, chemical studies of astatine can be performed only with very low concentrations - concentrations much less than the impurity levels commonly present in an experimental system. Radionuclide 211At has been newly discovered within development of nuclear medicine, because it has a&nbsp;lot of diserable and advantageous properties, that are required in cancer therapy. It's potential application was recognized due to the radiotoxicity associated with emission of a&nbsp;particle and that of its daughter 211Po.\nThis review presents current knowledge about chemistry of astatine, especially its inorganic chemistry (e.g. valence states, anionic complexes of astatine with halogenides and pseudohalogenides ions etc.). Moreover, information is given about synthesis of some organic compounds of astatine. Special attention was paid on labelling of biologically active molecules with 211At and their potential applications in nuclear medicine.",

            "abstract": "Peptides, as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and hormones take part in a&nbsp;number of physiological processes and thus are of enormous medical interest. However, the use of peptides as drugs is limited for example by degradation by proteases or poor bioavailability. One of the solutions of these problems seems to be application of peptidomimetics - compounds that act as substitutes for peptides in their interaction with receptors and can show higher metabolic stability, better bioavailability and longer duration of action [1?3].\nAzapeptides, peptide analogs in which a-CH group of one or more amino acid residues in the peptide chain is replaced by a&nbsp;nitrogen atom, have proved to be a&nbsp;class of useful peptidomimetics (Figure 1) [4].\nAzaamino acids provide unique conformational and configurational properties to the peptide chain which are caused by loss of asymmetry connected with a-carbon and free rotation around Ca-C' bond in the amino acid residue. According to the position of azaamino acid residue in the sequence, azapeptides can adopt different kinds of secondary structures and particularly - b-turns [6?8, 10?20].\nThis review presents different methods of azapeptide synthesis, either in solution (Figure 3) or on solid-phase [4, 21?36].\nIsoelectronic replacement of the a-CH group by nitrogen atom leads to some changes in the direct neighbourhood of the pseudoamide bond, which influence the biological activity of the azaanalogs of the natural substances. Azapeptides were synthesized and tested as analogs of hormones [39?42] as well as inhibitors of different types of enzymes [43?60]. Especially worth noting is application of azapeptides as protease inhibitors. Incorporation of the azaamino acid residue in the P1 position of an enzyme substrate allows the formation of an acyl-enzyme complex and on the other hand deactivates the complex toward nucleophilic attack of a&nbsp;water molecule in the last step of peptide bond hydrolysis (Figure 11).\nIn last years azapeptidic compound ? ReyatazTM (Atazanavir, BM-232632) has been discovered which seems to be a&nbsp;promising drug in the treatment of AIDS as it acts by blocking the activity of HIV-1 protease (Figure 13) [58?60].",

            "abstract": "It is known that both the nature and structure of a&nbsp;metal have a&nbsp;great influence on electrochemical processes. Interpretation of a&nbsp;mechanism of electrochemical reactions that occur on polycrystalline electrodes is often complicated because of their heterogeneous structure consisting of randomly distributed monocrystals on the surface. To avoid this problem, electrodes with well defined surfaces are commonly used in electrochemical experiments.\nIn this paper, effects of the surface structure of a&nbsp;metallic electrode on properties of the double layer of the metal/solution interface, electrosorption and also on the electrochemical reactions has been reviewed. The presented data refer mainly to the basic planes of monocrystalline electrodes of face-centered cubic system.\nIn first three chapters problems of the double layer structure of monocrystalline electrodes, the correlation of the potential of zero charge and work function, and the competition of a&nbsp;substrate and water molecules in the electrosorption process in relation to the hydrophilicity of metals are discussed.\nIn chapters 4 and 5 the influence of the surface structure on the adsorption of organic molecules, strongly and weakly interacting with the electrode surface, is reviewed. It was shown that the surface concentration of adsorbate depends not only on the number of adsorption sites (assumed as the surface atom density) but also on the geometry of adsorbed molecule as well as on the kind and size of the supporting electrolyte anions. The latter play a&nbsp;very important role when the interaction of an adsorbed molecule and a&nbsp;metal is weak. Chapter 6 concerns the role of the electrode surface structure in the hydrogen ion discharge and also underpotential deposition of ions.\nThe relationship between electrocatalytic properties of an electrode and its surface structure is presented in chapter 7. The kinetics of oxidation of methanol and formic acid at different planes of the platinum electrode and various products of the reduction of carbon oxide on copper monocrystalline electrodes are given as examples.",

            "abstract": "This paper is a&nbsp;short review of a&nbsp;spin-crossover phenomenon in complexes of iron(II). This phenomenon is related to the thermally induced transition between a&nbsp;diamagnetic low spin ground state (LS or S=0) and the excited paramagnetic high spin state (HS or S=2). Numerous compounds switch from a&nbsp;stable electronic state to another state in a&nbsp;reversible and detectable fashion in response to an appropriate and controllable external perturbation. This transition is accompanied by a&nbsp;strong thermochromism between rose and white colors. In certain cases, a&nbsp;hysteresis effect is accompanying this transition, which confers a&nbsp;memory effect to the system. The potential applications of spin transition (ST) molecular materials in the field of display and data processing has led to intensive studies of this phenomenon in the last ten years. For this purpose the compounds need to show a&nbsp;large thermal hysteresis, with the middle of the hysteresis loop falling as close as possible to room temperature. To achieve this goal iron(II) ST molecular materials are designed and synthesized as polymers in order to increase intermolecular interactions. In this paper some polymers based on 1,2,4-triazole derivatives are described because of their bridging nature leading to a&nbsp;strong cooperativity. The influence of various parameters, namely type of counter ion, R substituent in 4- position in the triazole ring, number of noncoordinated lattice water molecules, on the structure and ST regime of Fe(II)-1,2,4-triazole polymers is depicted. Some of the compounds presented might be of potential use as the electronic displays or switches.",

            "abstract": "The hydrogen bond, X-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y, is usually characterized as a&nbsp;relatively weak interaction involving the X-H bond (where X is an element with the electronegativity greater than that of H) and a&nbsp;region with high electron density (e.g. lone electron pairs of highly electronegative element Y or a&nbsp;\u03c0-electron system) [2-5, 8, 17-21, 27-52]. The interaction is believed to have predominantly electrostatic origin and is possibly accompanied by some charge transfer between X-H and Y. In the conventional picture of hydrogen bonding, there is attractive interaction between the region of high electron density (Y) and the polarized proton donor X-H bond that causes an elongation of the X-H bond and a&nbsp;concomitant decrease of its stretching frequency (red shift). This effect can be also reinforced by electron density transfer from the proton acceptor (Y) to the proton donor molecule. The direction of this transfer is primarily to the \u03c3* antibonding orbital of the X-H bond and consequently causes a&nbsp;weakening of this bond. The X-H bond in the X-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y system undergoes elongation and its stretching frequency is lowered. The red shift of the X-H stretching frequency is seen as the most important manifestation of the hydrogen bonding.\nHowever, in some cases it occurs that on complexation the X-H bond shortening and a&nbsp;concomitant stretching frequency shift to higher values (blue shift) may also take place. There are many experimental and theoretical evidences that this unconventional behaviour is more widespread than originally thought [75-79, 84-86, 96-101, 106-109]. Since for this kind of interaction the three main features of the classical hydrogen bond (elongation of X-H, red shift, and IR intensity increase) are all in opposite direction, this new type of bonding (interaction) is commonly referred to as improper, blue-shifting H-bond.\nIn this review several examples of the existence of the improper, blue-shifting hydrogen bonds are presented and the magnitude of the complex interaction energies, changes of bond lengths, and blue shifts are examined. To facilitate the understanding and meaning of diverse theoretical results, references to computational methods in use, are added. Particular attention is given to methods and theoretical ideas used in calculations for hydrogen-bonded systems.",

The search on compounds with agonistic and antagonistic properties of GABA receptors, the structure activity relationships, and therapeutic prospects of GABA receptors ligands was also described. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain [1-6], and influences neurons via a&nbsp;large number of receptor subtypes which are grouped on the basis of their pharmacology under three major classes of receptors: GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC. GABAA and GABAC receptors are ligand gated ion channels, while GABAB receptors are G-protein coupled receptors [7-10]. These receptors, especially GABAA receptors, are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders, and are therapeutic targets in certain diseases. Several different binding sites on GABAA receptors were proposed, these include agonist sites [11-14], which also recognize competitive antagonists [15], and many positive or negative modulators sites [16-20]. GABAA receptors are modulated by benzodiazepines [21-26], barbiturates, neurosteroides [27], klomethiazol [28, 29], anesthetics [30-33], ethanol [34], some insecticides [35], furosemide [36], Zn2+ iones [37], and sites for other compounds [38-40].

For example this hydrocarbon has extraordinary high melting point 269<sup>o</sup>C. It was also shown that the bromination is an ionic process; it is catalyzed by Lewis acids and not by peroxides or light. Adamantane possesses a&nbsp;unique rigid, but strain-free ring system, composed of three fused chair cyclohexane rings. The other source of adamantane derivatives are organic syntheses including cyclization and rearrangement of hydrocarbons. Also, it was found that 1-adamantanol refluxed with trifluoroacetic acid and respective heterocycles yielded N-adamantylated compounds [6].\nParticularly the biological properties of adamantane derivatives are very interesting. The most known of clinical use is the antiviral drug 1-amnoadamantane (amantadine) [7-11]. In the presented paper only antimicrobial, antiviral as well as anticancer agents are described. Novel ester imides synthesised from trimellitic acid chloride and 1-adamantanol, 2-adamantanol, 1-adamantanemethanol or 1-adamantaneethanol, were tested as antimicrobial compounds [16-18]. Some of these derivatives showed significant activity. The incorporation of L-alanine and L-phenylalanine aw well as \u03c9-amino acids into the phthalimide moiety as N-substituents, leads to strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus strains.\nA variety of 5'-N-phtaloyl-3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine derivatives has been synthesised and evaluated for their activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 [28]. Most of the AZT derivatives showed antiviral activity in the lower micromolar concentration range. It should be notice that all these compounds were inactive against HIV in thymidine kinase-deficient cells, pointing to the compounds' requirement to release free AZT to afford antiviral efficacy.\nTumor necrosis factor-alpha, so-called TNF-\u03b1, is a&nbsp;cytokine produced by numerous cell types among which monocytes/macrophages play a&nbsp;major role [29-40]. Investigation of the biological properties of TNF-\u03b1, in vitro as well as in vivo models, has revealed that this cytokine has both beneficial and unfavourable effects. In this context, it is interesting to search for new drugs working as stimulators or inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 production. It was found that N-(adamant-1-yl)monothiophthalimide and N-(adamant-2-yl)monothiophthal-imide showed over 200% enhancing of cytokine production, while some other imides were inhibitors.\nThe known drug bropirimine is orally active immunomodulator that stimulates production of \tTNF-\u03b1 and other cytokines and is now under phase II clinical trials for treatment of bladder carcinoma [43]. The inspiration for us was the search for bropirimine adamantane analogues [44]. The synthesis of adamantylated pyrimidines was based on the Traube reaction of 3-(adamantan-1-yl)-3-oxopropionic acid ethyl ester with urea, thiourea, guanidine as well as acetamidine, respectively. Then the compounds obtained were converted into respective bromo-, thio- and S-alkyl derivatives. The significant anticancer and antimicrobial properties of [2-(6-adamantan-1-yl-2-methylpyrimidin-4-ylsulfanyl)ethyl]dimethylamine were found.",

Such compounds are often isolated from plants or animals, where they fulfil different functions. Compounds a&nbsp;with gem-dimethylcycloxehane ring have been found in many marine algaes molluscs. These compounds show different biological properties, for example antibiotic [10, 66, 67, 79], cytotoxic [15, 16], fungicidal [17], inhibiting HIV [11]. Similar properties are also found in compounds isolated from plants growing in different places on Earth, plants which for many years have been known and used in tradicional medicine as antidote against different diseases [24-27, 36-46, 72-74]. These discoveries are very important for people searching for new and effective medicines against old and new diseases. For example some compounds with a&nbsp;gem-dimethylcyclohexane ring show an inhibitory effect on not yet curable cancers [50-57, 81].\nThe compounds with a&nbsp;gem-dimethylcyclohexane ring which occur in plants or animals have an affect not only on humans, but also on other plants or animals. Such affect can be observed in both marine and terrestial organisms [59-61, 71]. In our times very safe and effective crop protection is a&nbsp;very important problem. Because of this people try to find natural compounds which can produce desirable biological effects. Compounds with a&nbsp;gem-dimethylcycloxehane ring found in some plants can act as natural herbicides [22, 23]. Some of these compounds can also work as deterrents against insect pests. These deterrents affect the insects' sense of taste and prevent them from eating, which finally makes them die despite the abundance of food [28-33].",

Numerous potential applications of aerogels as catalysts and catalyst supports, adsorbents, sensors, insulators, Cherenkov detectors and many others attract attention of many research laboratories. This review demonstrates selected routes to obtain organic and carbon aerogels. a&nbsp;special attention is given to the materials obtained by polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde (RF aerogels). Some basis of the sol-gel processes as well as the influence of solvent on gelation time and shrinkage of the RF aerogels is presented. In the next part of the review the effect of the base preparation parameters i.e., resorcinol to formaldehyde (R/F) molar ratio and resorcinol concentration in solvent on textural properties on the final aerogel is discussed. Sol section of this paper is finished with information on the effect of catalyst concentration on particle size and shrinkage. Gel section contains informations about gelation time and aerogel properties dependence on it. Further sections are focused on drying step of the obtained gel, often found as the most important for the sake of final product characteristics. The reason why the drying step is so important is that solvent must be removed without destroying the gel matrix. Solvent removal methods are described with some principles of supercritical (low- and high-temperature) and freeze drying. Product obtained after supercritical or freeze drying step is called aerogel or cryogel respectively. Finally the effect of carbonization parameters on the carbon aerogels properties is described. Effect of other organic aerogel precursors such as cresol, phenol, furfural, melamine, PVC, MDI used in the sol-gel process of the preparation procedure of organic and carbon aerogels is described. Finally, selected technical applications of the carbon aerogels are presented.",

            "abstract": "Flavonoids belong to a&nbsp;large group of natural compounds of substantial biological activity. Some examples are rutin and hesperidin which are widely used in medical treatment. Recent growing interest in these compounds comes of their possible application as natural antioxidant protecting against harmful action of free radicals. Moreover, flavonols could complex metal cations and some of them are used as analytical reagents [6-8]. The major reason for limited application of flavonoids is their weak solubility in water.\nSulfonic derivatives of flavonoids due to the presence of sulfonic group in the molecule are well soluble in water. They form complexes with metal ions like their mother compounds and the complexation range is significantly wider than bioflavonoids. It in proposed to use quercetin-5'-sulfonic acid (QSA) (1) and sodium salt of morin-5'-sulfonic acid (NaMSA) (6) as new reagents in spectrophotometric determination of metals [18, 19]. Some of the compounds of Al, Ga and In with quercetin-5'-sulfonic acid and sodium salt of morin-5'-sulfonic acid show strong luminescence and for this reason can be used in laser technology. It has been found that sulfonic derivatives of quercetin could be an effective antidote against heavy metals - Hg(II), Cd, Pb(II) and as reported [37, 38] sodium salt of quercetin-5'-sulfonic acid (2) is a&nbsp;particularly active one. Sulfonic derivatives of quercetin, morin and chrysin, exhibit also the activity in different biological systems. It is supposed that sulfonic derivatives of flavonoids could have greater practical application than their mother compounds.",

            "abstract": "Attractive features of biological systems include versatility, substrate selectivity, regio-, chemo-, and enantioselectivity as well as catalysis at ambient temperatures and pressure. However, the challenge facing bioprocesses is cost competitiveness with existing chemical process assets. The current expansion of industrial biocatalysis can be attributed to recent progress in molecular biology, advanced instrumentation, and engineering. Novel catalyst formulation based on technology such as directed evolution and enzyme immobilisation, has resulted in improved types of highly active and stable biocatalysts.\nIn industrial biotransformations the immobilisation of enzymes on/in support is often chosen to enhance the stability and to simplify the biocatalyst recovery. The main purpose of this paper is to present a&nbsp;general picture of the immobilization techniques that is organised according to the two categories of methods, i.e., conventional methods (Part 1) and immobilisation in membrane reactors (Part 2).\nThe intention of the first part is outline the common procedures that span from binding on carrier materials to incorporation into in situ prepared matrix in which binding forces vary between weak adsorption and covalent binding. Although the development of suitable immobilisation protocol often follows empirical guidelines, some general rules to facilitate proper applications are also presented. Immobilisation of enzymes means a&nbsp;deliberate restriction of the mobility of the enzyme, which can also affect mobility of the solutes. Thus it is mandatory to have basic knowledge of the essential contribution of the chemical forces and the physicochemical interactions during heterogeneous catalysis that is also discussed. Finally, the technological developments in the field of immobilised biocatalysts are presented that show possibility of a&nbsp;wide and more economical exploitation of enzymes in industry, medicine, and in the monitoring devices like the biosensors.",

            "abstract": "Biocatalysis involves the enzyme-promoted transformations of a&nbsp;substrate into useful product in either a&nbsp;homogeneous or heterogenous system. The separation of reactants from products and the recovery and reuse of the catalyst from the reaction mixture is an important step that significantly decreases the cost of the process. Membrane reactors constitute an attempt to integrate catalytic conversion, product separation and/or concentration, and catalyst recovery into a&nbsp;single operation unit that lowers the overall cost of final product.\nIn an enzyme membrane reactor biocatalyst is immobilized within the reaction vessel or on/in a&nbsp;membrane (catalytic membrane). The paper shows two possibilities for immobilization of enzymes:\n1 - localization of the soluble biocatalyst in a&nbsp;certain defined region of space of a&nbsp;membrane reactor; e.g. a&nbsp;volume of a&nbsp;reactor and separation unit or in lumen/shell side of ultrafiltration unit;\n2 - adsorbed, deposited or bound (physically, via affinity ligand or by covalent attachment) to the surface of a&nbsp;membrane or entrapped within pores or material of the membrane.\nArguments counting for membrane supported or soluble enzymes are also presented. Reactors with soluble biocatalyst in a&nbsp;volume of a&nbsp;membrane reactor seem be suited to carry out complex enzymatic transformations, involving several enzymes and cofactor regeneration. Membrane reactors with catalytic membranes are particularly appropriate for nonconventional media such as organic-aqueous two-phase systems and for production of biosensing elements of enzyme electrodes. It is therefore the intention of the paper to outline the common immobilization methods and technologies to facilitate proper applications of enzymes immobilized in a&nbsp;membrane reactor.",

            "abstract": "The conventional hydrogen bonds, X-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y, are believed to arise due to the attractive interaction between the polarized proton donor (X-H) bond and the region of high electron density Y. This leads to the elongation of the X-H bond and the concomitant decrease of its stretching frequency (red shift). This effect can be further reinforced by electron density transfer from the proton acceptor (Y) to the proton donor molecule. The direction of this transfer is primarily to the \u03c3* antibonding orbital of the X-H bond and consequently causes its weakening. The X-H bond in the X-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y system undergoes elongation and its stretching frequency is lowered. The red shift of the X-H stretching frequency is seen as the most important manifestation of the hydrogen bonding.\nIn some cases, however, the complexation may lead to its shortening with the concomitant stretching frequency shift to higher values (blue shift). For this kind of interaction the three main features of the classical hydrogen bond (elongation of X-H, red shift, and IR intensity increase) are all in opposite direction and for this reason this new type of bonding (interaction) is commonly referred to as the improper, blue-shifting H-bond.\nIn Part II of this review different theories, which attempt to explain the origin of the blue shift, are discussed. Particular attention is given to the role of electrostatic interactions and charge transfer between interacting molecules. According to recently proposed models it is believed that the blue shift is mostly caused by the electrostatic interaction and is possibly enhanced by some intermolecular charge transfer from the proton acceptor molecule to remote parts of the proton donor. This is followed by the reorganization of the electron density distribution and structural changes in the whole proton donor molecule [12, 13]. Some other ideas and theories, which expose the role of the balance between electrostatic attraction and Pauli repulsion, are also discussed. Within these models there are no fundamental differences in the bonding characteristics of the red-shifting and blue-shifting H-bonded complexes; the blue shift is seen rather as an accidental result of the balance between different contributions to the interaction energy [6, 23].",

In addition, these commonly encountered compounds, due to their high reactivity, are valuable synthetic intermediates.\nLactones are particularly susceptible to nucleophilic attack. As a&nbsp;consequence, the cleavage of the lactone ring is a&nbsp;commonly used process in laboratory synthesis of organic compounds and in industry. Cleavage of lactones may be effected under variety of reaction conditions including reagents, catalysts, solvents and temperature. The chemoselectivity observed in these reactions allows selective reactions of multifunctional compounds, very often of rather complicated structure.\nThe enhanced reactivity of lactones toward nucleophiles makes hydrolysis their most investigated reaction. The ring cleavage occurs under basic (alkali metal hydroxides or alkoxides, tertiary amines) or acidic (Bronsted or Lewis acids) conditions. The effective cleavage of the lactone ring occurs also in reactions with nitrogen nucleophiles, which include ammonia, primary and secondary amines and hydrazine derivatives, as commonly used reagents. Sulphur and selenium derivatives are prepared in reactions of lactones with S- and Se-nucleophiles. The effective nucleophilic reducing agents include metal hydrides, of which lithium aluminium hydride is the most frequently used reagent. Other reducing agents like sodium borohydride and other complex boron hydrides have also been reported.\nReductive cleavage of lactones under catalytic hydrogenation conditions and with the aid of complex reducing systems are discussed. The metaloorganic reagents effectively cleave lactones, while a&nbsp;new carbon-carbon bonds are formed.\nSince the literature concerning transformations of lactones is enormous, in this review the selected examples are included to demonstrate usefulness of lactone cleavage reactions for diverse synthetic purposes.",

One of the most striking features of the carboranes is the capability of the two carbon atoms and ten boron atoms to adopt the icosahedral geometry in which the carbon and boron atoms are hexacoordinate. This feature of the icosahedral structure gives rise to the unusual properties of these molecules and their derivatives.\nBecause of their unique physical and chemical properties, carboranes have been used to prepare catalysts, radiopharmaceuticals, polymers and an assortment of coordination compounds and materials for nanotechnology. The medicinal chemistry of carboranes is centered on their use in boron neutron capture therapy of tumors (BNCT).",

The Directive has become the basis for corresponding legislation acts in the EU member and candidate countries, including Poland [13-16]. These events have focused the attention of the scientists to the necessity of development of methods suitable for the examination of enormous amounts and a&nbsp;variety of packaging materials for trace amounts of elements (ng g-1, \u03bcg g-1) that can occur in such materials.\nPapers, paperboards and plastics make the basis of packaging materials used. Traces of toxic substances in such materials can origin from contaminants occurring in various substrates (e.g. wood pulp, polymers), from numerous additives (e.g. catalysts, thermal stabilizers, adhesives, lubricants, antioxidants, pigments, printing inks) used in the production process as well as from process water and process equipment. a&nbsp;discussion of packaging materials produced as well as sources of toxic elements is presented in the paper in detail.\nAnalytical methods for the determination of traces of various elements (chromium, cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, antimony, molybdenum, barium, copper and zinc) in packaging materials developed by the authors have been described. Digestion procedures used for the transformation of the analytes from materials of various matrices (polymer (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate)), paper and paperboard) into solution are presented in Table 1. The application of modern analytical technique, inductively coupled plasma-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS), to the detection of the elements has been described. The ICP-TOFMS technique offers detection limits (DLs) suitable for the determination of a&nbsp;range of elements that can occur in packaging materials. The technique offers multi-element capability, selectivity, possibility of simultaneous isotope determinations, extremely high data-acquisition speed (quasi-simultaneous measurement of all masses extracted from the plasma ion source), high ion transmission and high sample throughput [34, 35]. Data for the isotopes used for the detection of the analytes as well as the detection and quantification limits achieved by the authors are given in Table 2. Results for the level of the elements determined in four groups of packaging materials examined, i&nbsp;and II: of polymer matrices intended for food- and non-food-packagings, respectively, and III and IV: of paper and paperboard matrices (for food- and non-food-packagings, respectively) have been given in Table 3.

            "abstract": "Derivatives of amino acids are known from their great biological relevance, for example can be used as pharmaceuticals, crop protection substances or food additives. In significant number of cases such substances show their biological potency only as single enantiomer. Therefore, one of the most important conditions during their production is to ensure their high optical purity. Generally, two routes to accomplish this goal are considered to be most effective. The first one is to synthesize enantiomers with the support of chiral catalyst introduced into the reaction mixture. The second approach involves the preparation of racemic mixture and in final step to separate it into single enantiomers. Considering the separation the most popular methods are enantiomers crystallization in the form of diastereoisomeric salts and chromatographic separation of racemates with application of chiral stationary phases. However, despite of their very extensive use, those methods possess several drawbacks and limitations. Among them, the most inconvenient are large use of solvents and expensive, chiral substances acting as agents responsible for the enantioseparation. Additionally, in case of chromatography some problems with non-linearity of the chromatographic process can take place. Therefore, the study on alternative ways of achieving the efficient separation of enantiomers is carried out in many laboratories. In this review, the very promising methods of the stereoisomers separation namely extraction and membrane techniques are presented and discussed. In case of extraction the examples of classical liquid - liquid extraction as well as aqueous - aqueous extraction and solid phase extraction application for amino acids enantiomers and their derivatives separation are described. The special attention is paid on the use of membrane techniques. The brief overview of applications of different membrane processes for the same purpose including the use of chiral polymer membranes, molecularly imprinted membranes, achiral membranes with chiral agents (solution free or immobilized) and liquid membranes is also presented. Finally, the examples of preparative scale processes, in which extraction and membrane techniques were used, are also discussed to show their applicability for the production of amino acids and their derivatives with high amounts and optical purity.",

Porphyrins and their complexes with metal ions play important role in several biological as well as catalytic systems.

Several porphyrins become useful as the high sensitive chromogenic reagents. The stable complexes between transition metals and porphyrin ligands enable coordinating interaction with additional ligands above and below the molecule plane, so these compounds are used as components of membranes of ion selective electrodes in potentiometry and voltammetry. Several porphyrins find applications as optical sensors and biosensors. Due to the mixed mechanism of interaction between porphyrin macrocycle and various solutes, porphyrins find interesting applications as stationary phases in HPLC for separation of aromatic carboxylates, sulfonates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fullerenes as well as amino acids and peptides. In capillary electrophoresis these compounds found application as the derivatizing agents.

            "abstract": "NMR spectroscopy is a&nbsp;powerful method that allows detetmination of the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids and their complexes in solution with atomic resolution. a&nbsp;major breakthrough in the structure determination of nucleic acids by NMR was introduction of advanced and efficient methods for the labeling of RNA and DNA with 13C and 15N and development of multidimensional, heteronuclear NMR techniques analogous to those used in protein NMR spectroscopy.\nThe resonance assignment is a&nbsp;crucial step in the NMR study. a&nbsp;spectrum must be assigned before useful structural information can be extracted. The assignment of RNA is considerably more difficult than for DNA of similar size. This is mainly due to the much narrower spectral dispersion of the H2', H3', H4' and H'/5 \" ribose protons relative to DNA. The methodology for sequential assignment of nucleic acids via lomonuclear NMR techniques relies on the assumption of helical structure and therefore fails in the case of nonhelical structures, that is typical of RNA.\nDevelopment of 13C/15N labeling techniques has afforded heteronuclear multidementional experiments that utilize the favorable properties of 13C and 15N nuclei such as large one-and two-bond heteronuclear scalar coupling constants and large chemical shift dis-persion. These experiments provide increased sensitivity of double and triple resonance experiments and help in overcoming the problem of severe spectral overlap.\nProgress in novel NMR methods stimulated also a&nbsp;design of experiments for conformationindependent sequential assignment. In nucleic acids, experiments that correlate base resonances among themselves as well as with sugar resonances allow unambiguous spectral assignment for the structures, where the conventional NOE-based methods may not be applied. Assignments of highly overlapped sugar resonances are facilitated enormously by the application of correlated experiments based on 13C-13C transfer. Additionally, triple resonance experiments allow correlation of neighboring nucleotides through the phosphodiester backbone.\nThe arsenal of existing methods in structure calculations of nuclcic acids by NMR spectroscopy has recently been extended. For example, NMR methods have been developed to detect and measure scalar couplings via hydrogen bonds. The information about hydrogen bonds provides very useful restraints for structural determination, especially in case of noncanonical motifs.\nFurthermore, the use of methods that introduce anisotropic environments for nucleic acids in solution allows the measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDC). RDCs yield orientation, rather than distance-based constraints. The RDCs contain global structural information on nucleic acids that cannot be obtained by standard solution NMR techniques. These constraints can both improve the local structure of nucleic acids and provide novel data on the global structure.\nAnother NMR technique, TROSY has been introduced to effectively suppress transverse relaxation of 1H-15N and 1H-13C moieties. TROSY selects exclusively the narrow line of a&nbsp;1H-15N doublet or 1H-13C multiplet, yielding improved spectral resolution and increased sensitivity of NMR experiment.\nRecent advances in solution NMR techniques provide tools for structural studies of large (> 30 residues) nucleic acids molecules.",

The techniques of magic angle spinning, cross-polarization, as well as the experiments with variable cross-polarization time and dipolar-dephasing pulse sequences are illustrated. The spectra measured for solutions are frequently used as an aid in the assignment of solid-state ones. The differences \u0394=\u03b4solution-\u03b4solid state are explained in terms of conformational effects (resulting from frozen intramolecular reorientation in the solids) and intra- and intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds and also short intermolecular contacts in the crystals).\nSolid-state NMR spectroscopy has become an important technique in the field of pharmaceutical sciences. Solid-state techniques are used for the characterization of pharmaceutical solids: drug substances and dosage forms (tablets) and their mutual interactions. Structural information on solid antibiotics (penicillin salts, erythromycin A, chloramphenicol and its derivatives), anticoagulants (warfarin, sintrom), antimalaria (artemizinin) or anxiolytic drugs (buspirone and its analogues) was obtained by the analysis of 13C CP MAS spectra. Frequently exploited area is polymorphism because pharmaceutical polymorphs can display different solubilities, dissolution rates and bioavailability. Polymorphic forms of steroids (testosterone, prednisolone, cortisone) and 4-azasteroids (finasteride) and of numerous other drugs (e.g. AZT, paracetamol, phenobarbital) have been detected. Solid-state NMR has thus an ability to differentiate polymorphs, determine asymmetry in the crystal unit cell and investigate molecular motions within the solids.\nMAS NMR spectra can be recorded for powdered tablets, enabling fast identification of the active substance. Few examples of forensic applications include \"Extasy\" and Viagra tablets. The technique ideally lends itself to the studies on drugexcipients interaction, possible conversions of the drug during processing and storage can be followed.\nMultinuclear solid state NMR is also useful in characterization of materials and tissues removed during surgery (bones, brain tumors, urinary stones).",

            "abstract": "Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis based on L\u00f6wdin's concept of \"natural'' orbitals [1] is used to describe the unique set of orthonormal 1-electron functions and to express the density \u0398i(r) of \u03c1(r) \u03a8. Natural bond orbitals are typically localized orbitals and provide the most accurate possible \"natural Lewis structure'' pattern of \u03a8, because all orbital details like polarization coefficient or atomic hybrid composition are mathematically chosen to include the highest possible percentabe of the electron density [2].\nThis concept adapted by Frank Weinhold and co-workes in NBO's package [3] provides the information about charges, bond types, hybrid directions, resonance weights, bond orders, etc. The NBO program comprises a&nbsp;sequence transformation from the input basis set to various localized basis sets, including natural atomic (NAO), hybrid (NHO), and (semi-)localized molecular orbital (NLMO) sets.\nWidespread acceptance of the NBO paradigm by scientist in all fields of chemistry results in over 500 published applications per year. NBO-based techniques are being employed from donor-acceptor intermolecular interaction [4], and particular effectiveness in elucidating resonance-type stereoelectronic and steric factors, to nature of H-bonding in clusters, liquids and enzymes [5], and analysis of electronic principles of photexited and radical species.",

            "abstract": "The credit for the discovery of liquid crystals must go to F. Reinitzer who in a&nbsp;paper submitted on May, 1888 described his observations of the colored phenomena occurring in melts of cholesteryl benzoate [9]. He noted the \"double melting\" behavior in this case, whereby the crystals transformed at 145,5\u00b0C into a&nbsp;cloudy fluid, which suddenly clarified only on heating to 178\u00b0C.\nMesophases are a&nbsp;state of order between crystals and liquids. They have imperfect long range orders of orientation and/or position. Thus, they can be fluid like a&nbsp;liquid and they can have anisotropic properties like crystals. The liquid crystals have a&nbsp;predominating orientational order [1].\nDespite intensive research activities of numerous research groups on polymers no systematic study on liquid crystalline polyimides had been published before 1985. Only two patents of Du Pont filed in 1979 reported on LC poly(ester imide)s [14, 15]. The fundamental study on this area was made by Kricheldorf [16-38]. He found that the most promising substrate for synthesis of liquid crystalline poly(ester imide)s was trimellitic anhydride. It forms imide ester mesogenic group in main polymer chain.\nOn the other hand it has been found that isolated phthalimide moiety not favor liquid crystalline order [47] but connected with ester groups increases a&nbsp;possibility of forming mesophase.\nLow molecular weight cholesteric ester imides with oxyethylene spacers form liquid crystal SmA2 phase. It is possible due to microsegregation of hydrophobic parts of molecules [48, 50, 53]. Similar compounds with polymethylene spacers exhibit monolayer SmA phase. In this case microsegregation is impossible.\nAlso ester imides based on biphenyl mesogenic moiety show termotropic behavior [49, 51, 52]. Cyanobiphenyl derivatives of such trimellitimides form a&nbsp;partially bilayered smectic Ad phase for the homologues with long N-alkyl substituents [51]. The monolayer smectic A1 phase was observed for all members of 4'-undecyloxybiphenyl derivative series while the longer homologues exhibited SmA-SmC dimorphism.\nThe reaction of imide compounds with Lawesson's reagent leads to monothio- and dithioimides, respectively. Liquid crystalline ester thioimides were obtained at first time by Orzeszko and Bia\u0142ecka [56]. An incorporation of one or two sulfur atoms into an imide ring results in reduction of phase transition temperature values. This is a&nbsp;consequence of the considerable change of compound polarity and the increase of the molecular breadth.",

            "abstract": "Chemistry and biochemistry of glycoconjugates have been a&nbsp;serious challenge for scientists since many years. Among the huge number of glycoconjugates there is a&nbsp;large group of compounds called saponins, specific glycosides that can be found in many plants. However, they can also be collected from some marine organisms. Nowadays, the main source of saponins is the flora of tropical and temperate zones, such a&nbsp;kind of plants: Costus, Discorea, Paris, Solanum, Trigonella, Trillium and Yucca. Furthermore, the large quantities of saponin can be found in food and beverage plants, including oats, peanuts, soybeans, garlic, onion, spinach, leafs of tea, etc. They are active components of some herbs used in therapeutics, e.g. in Poland the fenugreek seeds are used as a&nbsp;decoction for treatment of skin inflammation, moreover they are the components of antisnoring drops, as well as a&nbsp;part of nutrients for culturists. In Orient countries the number of saponins have long been used as pharmaceutical agents, such as those from ginseng, red clover, licorice, horse chestnut, senega and from many others traditional Chinese herbal medicinal plants [1, 2, 27].\nThe popularity of the discussed group of glycosides comes from their interesting bioactivity. Biological investigations showed that saponins stop the sedimentation process of lipids on the aorta-wall, they slow down the production of sugars, proteins, lipids and bile acids in the liver. Furthermore, they are good antifungal and antibacterial agents, also show an anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activity. It has been found that the crude extract of some plants, especially in the aerial portion, containing the diosgenin glycosides display anti-neoplastic properties against several strains of human cancer cells [4?9].\nStructurally, the saponins are classified as steroid or triterpenoid glycosides depending upon the nature of the aglycone, which is generally called sapogenin. The steroid saponins have cyclopentaphenantrene backbone in aglycone, for example diosgenin, tigogenin, sarsapogenin. Saponins containing nitrogen in aglycone backbone belong also to this group. Triterpenoid saponins have usually 30-carbon atoms in tetra- or pentacyclic aglycone. The carbohydrate residue (hydrophilic part of glycosides), usually a&nbsp;mono-, di-, tri- or tetrasaccharide, is covalently attached to the sapogenin backbone (hydrophobic element). The sugar moiety, in most saponins, is attached to the 3-OH of a&nbsp;sapogenin via the 1,2-trans-glycosidic bond. The difficulties in isolation of homogeneous saponins from natural sources prompted chemists to the synthesis of these type compounds. Chemical synthesis could provide a&nbsp;real way to the availability of required saponins [10?104].\nThe largest and also the most interesting class of saponins is the first group - the steroid saponins, because of their biological activity. To this group belong three class of compounds: cholestanoic, furostanoic and spirostanoic saponins.",

            "abstract": "The arsenic is an element which comes in the twentieth place in respect of its dissemination in the earth's crust and fourteenth in seawater. Average concentrations of arsenic in the earth's crust are reported to be 1,5 - 6 mg/kg [4, 5, 7-11]. In the geosphere arsenic occurs connected especially with sulfide minerals. As a&nbsp;chalcophylic element it is commonly present in sulfide ores of other metals, mainly pyrites, chalcopyrites, galenite and zincblende. Arsenic is a&nbsp;constituent of more than 200 minerals (tab. 2).\nSources of arsenic in the environment are natural and anthropogenic in essence. More than several dozens tons of arsenic are released annually to the terrestrial and aquatic environment and to the atmosphere [6, 11, 12].\nNatural sources of arsenic include volcanic activity, weathering, soil erosion, forest and grass fires and biological activity. Anthropogenic sources are mainly smelting of non-ferrous metal ores and burning of fossil fuel in household and power plants [7, 10, 16]. Anthropogenic sources also include the production and application of arsenic compounds (tab. 4). From ages they were used in medicine, metallurgy and dye-production. In the last few hundred years arsenic compounds were also used in agriculture, wood-preservation, warfare production and semiconductor industry. In XVIII and XIX centuries the essential usage of arsenic was medicine. Until the discovery of antibiotics arsenotherapy was applicable in the treatment of a&nbsp;majority of diseases (fig. 3). In the XX century the most important applications arsenic compounds have found in agriculture and wood-preservation (fig. 5). In the first half of that century about 90% of the arsenic produced was used to manufacture a&nbsp;variety of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. The utilization of arsenic compounds was systematically limited along with increasing of the ecological consciousness. Nowadays the use of arsenic in medicine and agricultural is declining. The most of the produced arsenic is used to manufacture Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) a&nbsp;wood preservative which is going to be replaced by alternative preservatives in the near future [81]. Small amounts of arsenic are utilized in the semiconductor industry, metallurgy and in the manufacturing of glass. Most of the arsenic is produced in form of arsenic trioxide, which is a&nbsp;by-product during the smelter of nonferrous ores.\nArsenic compounds are mobile in environment and occur in natural waters, soils and in the air. Arsenic is mainly transported by water among environmental media and it is undergoing chemical and physical transformations (oxidation/reduction, metylation/demetylation, adsorption/desorption). In natural environment arsenic occurs mainly as inorganic species: arsenate and arsenite. In these chemical compounds certain bacteria can replace hydroxyl groups by methyl groups forming methyl derivatives, mainly monomethyl arsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMAA). Methylated arsenic species can be transformed by bacteria, fungi and yeasts under anaerobic conditions to volatile forms of arsenic: monomethylarsine (MMA), dimethylarsine (DMA), trimethylarsine (TMA) and arsine (AsH3) (fig. 9). In the air arsenic exists mainly adsorbed on particle matter in the form of arsenic trioxide, arsenate and arsenite.\nArsenic compounds are toxic for humans and animals. The toxicity depends mainly on the chemical forms and oxidation states of arsenic, the most toxic are inorganic arsenites. Ingestion of a&nbsp;large dose of inorganic arsenicals can lead to death (tab.6). a&nbsp;long-term exposure to arsenic increases risks of cancer in skin, lungs, bladder and kidney. Inorganic arsenicals have been classified as Group i&nbsp;carcinogens [136].\nThis review represents a&nbsp;comprehensive knowledge about the present and old applications of arsenic, the anthropogenic sources of this element, the circulation of arsenic in the environment and its impact on human health.",

The family of ruthenium based catalysts tolerant of normal organic and polymer processing conditions and preserving their catalytic properties in the presence of the majority of functional groups has allowed a&nbsp;great number of new applications. The monograph gives a&nbsp;review of literature on well-defined ruthenium catalysts of olefin metathesis published till the end of 2004. The activity of catalytic systems based on different ruthenium complexes in metathetic reactions has been characterised. The methods of obtaining alkylidene complexes of ruthenium showing catalytic activity in olefin metathetic tranformations have been described together with the reactions in which these compounds can be used as precatalysts.\nBecause of a&nbsp;large body of literature data on Grubbs catalysts and their significance in synthesis, much space is devoted to them, including the methods of their synthesis and the known processes leading to their decomposition. Elements of the mechanism of olefin metathesis the presence of Grubbs catalysts of the 1st and 2nd generation are presented together with the consequences for designing of new catalysts of the process. The catalysts containing a&nbsp;chelating alkylidene ligand, in particular the Hoveyda-Grubbs catalysts arousing increasing interest and already commercially available, have been discussed. Moreover, the paper provides characterisation of the cationic alkylidene complexes described by Hoffmann, allenylidene, vinylidene and alkylidynehydride complexes described by Werner. Preliminary results on obtaining chiral alkylidene ruthenium catalysts and their use in the asymmetric synthesis are also presented. Regarding a&nbsp;number of prospective commercial applications of metathesis in organic synthesis, the current status of the study on heterogenization of alkylidene ruthenium complexes in order to obtain active and stable catalysts for multiple use was described. The paper ends with a&nbsp;list of the most important, in the opinion of the author, monographs and review works on the application olefin metathesis catalysed by well-defined alkylidene complexes in organic and polymer synthesis.\nKeywords: olefin metathesis, ruthenium alkylidene complexes, catalysts of olefin metathesis, organic synthesis, polymer synthesis",

            "abstract": "The discussion of chemical reactions caused by ionizing radiation is started, as usual, with the nature of the object which absorbs the energy. First, the composition (CO2 = 95.3%) and density of martian atmosphere is discussed; the latter is low, 120 times smaller than over the Earth and does not protect the surface of Mars from ionizing radiations. The atmosphere over the Earth secures the shield equivalent to 3 m of concrete, with many positive consequences for the Life on Earth. In addition, high energy protons from the Sun are diverted magnetically around the Earth, and that is not the case around the Mars. The radiolysis of Martian atmosphere starts with formation of CO2+ as the primary product of single ionization spurs. The multi-ionization spurs can yield exotic carbon-oxygen compounds, not explored yet. Anyway, the radiolysis of martian atmosphere is completely different from the case of Earth, where the primary product is N2+ ion-radical. The lack of water vapor over Mars prevents the formation of an analogue to acid rains, and of creation of many other compounds.\nThe most interesting feature of Martian regolith is the possibility of the pre-sence of hydrated minerals, which could have been formed milliards years ago, when (probably) water was present on Mars. Water present in the crystalline lattice undergoes only limited radiolysis, as it is known from the case of concrete, produced as biological shield build on Earth, around the sources of ionizing radiation. Formation of natural hydrated silicates on Mars was possible, therefore survival of traces of H2O on Mars is possible. However, this kind of water cannot be recovered easily, to be used by Mars explorers.\nThe interface of the atmosphere and the regolith is probably the site of many chemical reactions. Very intensive UV, which includes part of the vacuum UV, can cause reduction of carbon dioxide to methane, recently discovered in traces over Mars, hopefully, but erroneously connected, in the mode of wishful thinking, to the Life. Minerals like sodalite, discovered on Mars can contribute as reagents in the mentioned reaction, and could be the source of hydrogen.\nConclusions are dedicated to questions of the live organisms connected with exploration of Mars; from microorganisms, comparatively resistant to ionizing radia-tion, to human beings, considered not to be fit to manned flight, survival on Mars and return to Earth. The genius of Mankind which is able to create effective means of exploration over the distance of millions of kilometers, should be a&nbsp;satisfaction more important than the extremely expensive presence of man or woman on Mars.\nKeywords: atmosphere of Mars, manned exploration of space, origins of life, prebiotic chemistry, radiobiology, regolith chemistry",

            "abstract": "The paper reviews the thermodynamic of the most important problems of wett-ability of a&nbsp;solid and correlation between adsorption of surface active agents at water-air, and solid-air interfaces and wettability of hydrophobic low-energy solids.\nThree types of wetting have been considered; spreading wetting, adhesional wetting and immersional wetting. The usefulness of the Good and Girifalco, Fowkes, Owens and Wendt, and van Oss et al. approaches to interfacial free energy of liquid-liquid and solid-liquid for determination of work of spreading, immersion and adhesion is presented. The correlation between the work of spreading, immersion and adhesion and contact angle is also shown.\nOn the basis of the contact angle the relationship between wettability of the solids and its surface free energy and surface tension of liquid is discussed. Zisman found for low-energy solids a&nbsp;straight linear relationship between cos\u03b8 (\u03b8 is the cotact angle) and surface tension of liquids or aqueous surfactant solutions. The extrapolation of this relationship to cos\u03b8=1 allows estimation of the liquid surface tension required to give a&nbsp;contact angle to zero degree, which Zisman described as the critical surface tension. However, in contrary to Zisman, Bergeman and van Voorst Vader, stated that there is straight linear relationship between the adhesional tension (\u03b3LV cos\u03b8) and surface tension \u03b3LV, of aqueous solution of several types of surface active agents (surfactants). Such relationship was also confirmed by other investigators, however, the different equations describing the wettability of the same solids than Bergeman and van Voorst Vader by aqueous solutions of surfactants has been suggested.\nA direct method to investigate relative adsorption at interfaces is described. The usefulness of Lucassen-Reynders equation derived from Young and Gibbs equations for the studies of the correlation between adsorpion of the surface active agents at water-air and solid-water interfaces and wettability of low-energy hydrophobic solids is discussed.\nWe proved that on the basis of the surface tension of low-energy hydrophobic solids, surface tension of aqueous solution of surfactants or their mixtures, and Fowkes approach to interfacial tension the wettability of low-energy hydrophobic solids can be predicted.\nKeywords: adhesion, adsorption, wettability, spreading coefficient, contact angle, critical surface tension of wetting, surface active agents",

            "abstract": "The \"jasmine chemistry\" started in 1899 [6]. cis-Jasmone, a&nbsp;naturally occuring derivative of cyclopentenone is an important constituent of the essential oil of the jasmine flowers. It occurs in jasmine oil at the amount of 2-3%. cis-Jasmone can be obtained from fresh flowers by means of time-consuming and laborious extraction process, known as enfleurage [8, 9] and that is why it has been the object of number synthetic efforts.\n3-Methyl-2-(2-cis-penten-1-yl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one is a&nbsp;chemical name of cis-jasmone. From a&nbsp;structural point of view it is a&nbsp;relatively simple compound which has been synthesized many times via many different pathways. Since pioneering works of Treff and Werner [4] (Scheme 1) and then Hunsdiecker [17] (Scheme 2) efforts to develop efficient syntheses of this compound have been developed to find more economical procedure. Commercial synthesis of jasmone is based on the alkylation reaction of 3-methyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one using cis-pentenyl chloride in the rpesence of PTC catalyst (Scheme 9) [9, 29, 30]. Because of the difficulty with its manufacturing, the price is still relatively high.\nThe present short review desribes methods of cis-jasmone preparation. Very interesting and economical group of methods seems to be the group that involves furan derivatives such as furfural, 2-methylfuran, furfuryl alcohol. The major disadvantage of this route are rather vigorous hydrolytic conditions that are necessary for opening the furan ring, which sometimes leads to undesired changes in the molecule (Schemes 2-12). Other cyclic compounds, cyclopentadiene for example, canalso be used to conduct synthesis of cis-jasmone (Schemes 14-17). The most common and successful method to obtain correctly 2,3-disubstituted cyclopentenone is based on the preliminary preparation of unsymmetrically substituted 1,4-diketones. These usuful intermediates are subsequently cyclized under bacis conditions to jasmone (Schemes 18-36). Synthetic ways connecting furan derivatives and cyclization of 1,4-diketones were firstly indicated in 1942 by Hunsdiecker [17], who carried out a&nbsp;complete synthesis of jasmone from 5-methylfuralaldehyde (Scheme 2). Syntheses of jasmone have been reported by many authors but most of those routes are either too lengthy or involve expensive chemicals. This molecule is still a&nbsp;popular synthetic goal and the wealth of different new methods has been published.\nKeywords: jasmine, cis-jasmone, fragrance substance, furan derivatives, 1,4-diketones",

The possible application arise from the remarkable properties of CNTs such as the highest Young's modulus, highest thermal conductivity, ballistic electron transport, and high aspect ratio structure. To date, development of nanotube-based products has been delayed by a&nbsp;lack of availability of quantities of pure material and lack of control of their growth.\nThere are many methods for CNTs production: carbon arc, chemical vapour deposition of hydrocarbons, laser ablation or electrolysis in molten salts. Each of these methods leads to the raw product, which contains albo by-products: amorphous and turbostratic carbon, carbon nanoonions and encapsulates, catalyst nanoparticles, along with the carbon nanotubes. As mentioned above, high-purity CNTs are required in order to retain excellent intrinsic properties and to proceed with further realistic applications.

            "abstract": "In 2001 prof. K.B. Sharpless from Scripps Institute has announced a&nbsp;new idea for an easier and faster molecular discovery, named click chemistry. This concept bases on the following observations:\nClick chemistry embraces therefore a&nbsp;set of powerfull reactions which must be modular, wide in scope, highly yielding, generating easily removable byproducts (with no need for chromatographic purification) and stereoselective. These reaction should be also insensitive to oxygen and water and preferably carried out under simple conditions. Click reactions achieve their efficienty due to the high thermodynamic driving force, usually greater than > 20 kcal/mol (thus can be recognized as spring-loaded for a&nbsp;single trajectory). Examples of this reactions include: nucleophilic opening of strained rings (epoxides, aziridines), cycloadditions (e.g. 1,3-dipolar or Diels-Alder type reaction), additions to carbon-carbon multiple bond (epoxidation, dihydroxylation, Michael addition) and some types of carbonyl chemistry (Scheme 1).\nAn illustration of this concept is multigram 4-step synthesis of products 2a and 2b (Scheme 2) without the use of chromatography. Click chemistry idea was discussed in detail by Sharpless in [1] and [4].\nHuisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is cream of the crop of various click reactions and was used in many notable applications of click chemistry concept, highlighted in this review. This reaction is strongly thermodynamically activated (35-50 kcal/mol), modular and of wide scope, it shows also perfect atom economy and provides products with high yield after usually simple workup. Moreover, due to the stability of reactants and 1,2,3-triazoles to various reactions conditions, including oxygen and water, this cycloaddition can be carried out in water [7-10].\nTarget guide synthesis combined with 1,3-dipolar Huisgen reaction was used for finding new, most potent (active in femtomolar concentration) acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (Scheme 4) [14-15] and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors 5a,b (Scheme 5) [16]. Other inhibitors developed by synthesis and screening of 1,2,3-triazole libraries include \u03b1-1,3-flukosyltransferase VI (Scheme 6) [17], HIV-protease (Scheme 7) [18]. 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition was also used for modification of antibiotic tyrosidine [19] and vancomycine [20] and the modified products 10a,b and 11a,b exhibit better therapeutic index and activity respectively. Important applications of Huisgen reaction in molecular biology include bioconiugation and labeling techniques. Cowpea virus was efficiently labeled by fluorescein derivatives (Scheme 8) [22] and cell surfaces were decorated by various biotin derivatives (Scheme 9) [23-24] using appropriate azide-alkyne components. Click chemistry in this field was also used for designing new methods for labeling protein (Scheme 10) [25-26], in vitro or in vivo protein profiling (Scheme 11) [27] and DNA sequencing (Scheme 12) [28].\nMany important applications of 1,3-Huisgen cycloaddition are found in material chemistry. These include efficient synthesis of dendrimers without the use of chromatography (Scheme 13) [31] or dendronised polymers (Scheme 14) [32]. 1,2,3-Triazole linker formation was utilized for functionalisation of poly(norbornenes) (Scheme 15) [33], modular copolymer synthesis (Scheme 16) [34] and silicon waffers [37] or gold surface [38] modification (Scheme 18). 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition was also used in the synthesis of new fluorescent cumarines 54 [39], two-photon absorption chromophores 55 [40] and water-soluble calixarenes 56 [41].\nHuisgen reaction was recently widely explored for modification of natural products and biomolecules and many interesting 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of sugars, aminoacids and peptides, lipids, steroids and alkaloids were synthesized (62-74) [29, 42-52].\nIn summary, in a&nbsp;relatively short period of time after its introduction, click chemistry concept was widely approved in various areas and resulted in many important applications. Thus it can be regarded as a&nbsp;versatile toolbox for \"production of molecular properties\".\nKeywords: organic synthesis, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, click chemistry",

            "abstract": "Conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane derivatives depends on the location of the substituents in carbocyclic ring. Equatorial location of non-hydrogen substituents dominate over axial one because in the latter case there exist unfavourable 1,3-diaxial interactions. The solvent effect on the equilibrium is well known. Diequatorial conformer of trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane is favoured over the diaxial one in polar solvents, while diaxial conformer is favoured in non-polar solvents. Conformational equilibrium of cis-1,3-hexanediol is controlled by intramolecular hydrogen bond, whose strength depends on the solvent polarity (Fig. 3) [19].\nReplacement of one or more methylene groups by oxygen atoms in carbocyclic ring changes conformational equilibrium of variously substituted tetrahydropyrans or dioxane derivatives as is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Conformational equilibrium of \u03b1-substituted tetrahydropyran depends on the structure and chemical character of the substituent. Electron-withdrawing groups flavour axial orientation. This phenomenon is called endo-anomeric effect, (AE) [17] and is characteristic for compounds with C-X-C-Y structural fragment, where X is N, o&nbsp;or S and Y is F, Cl, Br, O, N or S. This effect is revealed in non-polar solvents, while the equatorial orientation of C-1-substituent is preferred in strongly polar solvents [14]. The effect is associated with shortening of the X-C-1 and elongation of the C-1-Y bonds (Fig. 11) [26]. Hyperconjugation of the non-bonding orbital of oxygen atom and antibonding \u03c3*orbital of the C-1-Y bond is responsible for this effect [9-11, 23]. Gibss free energy of the anomeric effect decreases in the order: halogen atom > OR > SR > OH > NH2 > C. Conformational or/and anomeric equilibrium of sugars and its derivatives is controlled by anomeric effect and so called instability factors (IF). Non-bonded interactions between groups in the sugar ring, i.e. IF, are well known and exhaustively discussed in the literature [33-35].\nIn the molecules of glycosides and their derivatives apart from endo-anomeric effect, also exo-anomeric effect is present, which determines the spatial orientation of the aglycon in relation to the sugar ring [17]. The latter effect concerns both anomers and favours such an aglycon orientation in which the dihedral angle O-5-C-1-O-1 C is +sc (for \u03b1-D-anomer) and -sc for \u03b2-D-anomer. The above mentioned arrangement enables hyperconjugation of non-bonding sp3 orbital of O-1 (exo) atom with the antibonding orbital of O-5-C-1 bond. This effect is responsible for the spartial structure of some polysaccharides.\nNitrogen substituens (especially those with a&nbsp;positive charge) and carbon substituents are preferably located in the equatorial orientation due to the so called reverse anomeric effect (RAE) [18]. This effect is characteristic for N-(glycopyranosyl)pyridinium, -imidazolium and similar salt [32, 42, 43]. Some authors suggest that RAE does not exist and the equilibrium state of such compounds depends on the exo-anomeric or steric effects [45, 46-48].\nKeywords: conformational equilibria, exo- and endo-anomeric effect, reverse anomeric effect",

            "abstract": "Adsorption of phenolic compounds on activated carbons is considered based on survey of abundant literature on it. Phenols belong to a&nbsp;group of common environmental contaminants. Since they are highly toxic and, in general, not amenable to biological degradation, methods of treatment are continuously being modified and developed. Adsorption by activated carbons is the best and most frequently used method to remove phenols from waters. Numerous factors are known to have important influence on this phenomenon: type of carbon, carbon surface functionalities, pH value of the coexisting bulk liquid phase, oxygen availability, etc. In this review, we have tried to discuss the significance of the above-mentioned factors. The first chapter of the review deals with characterization of the activated carbon from the point of view of application for phenols uptake. The selection of precursors of activated carbon as well as generation of porosity and surface chemical composition are taken into account. Adsorption of phenolic compounds has been described critically, showing the development of investigations on the subject and presenting some of the most important results. a&nbsp;special attention is paid to the effect of surface functionalities and pH of solution. These two factors are considered together, because owing to the amphoteric character of a&nbsp;carbon surface its surface properties may be influenced by the pH value of the coexisting liquid bulk phase. The fundamental mechanisms of phenol adsorption have been emphasized i.e. \"\u03c0-\u03c0 interactions\" and \"donor-acceptor complex formation\", taking into account the influence of the so-called \"solvent effect\". Energetic heterogeneity of activated carbons is presented on the basis of adsorption energy distribution functions, calculated by using algorithm based on a&nbsp;regularization method. Analysis of these functions provides significant comparative information about their heterogeneity. Problems associated with irreversible adsorption from aqueous solutions of phenols and their surface polymerization are reported in vast paragraph. We concluded that the presence of molecular oxygen and its amount has significant influence on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for phenol and its derivatives. Oxidative coupling in the presence of molecular oxygen causes irreversible adsorption (chemisorption). Effects of different substituents of phenols are considered too. Bigger size and/or larger number of groups of an adsorbate lead to a&nbsp;higher heterogeneity for the same surface. It has been stressed that, neither of the substituent groups was involved directly in the interaction with the carbon surface, but they contribute to the electron-acceptor characteristics of the aromatic ring of the solute. The cheap precursors of activated carbons from the waste materials are also described in our review. Finally, some remarks dealing with application of novel adsorbents for phenols adsorption, such as activated carbon fibers are discussed.\nKeywords: adsorption, phenolic compounds, activated carbon, heterogenous sorbents, energy distribution function, reversible and irreversible adsorption, environmental protection",

The metals sequential extraction for a&nbsp;given sample depend among others on the type of sample, leaching reagent, conditions of the process, the initial condition of sample (environmental sample, air-dried sample) and chemical forms of metals presents in sample. Most often the studies evaluate the chemical fraction of metals in environmental sample as: exchangeable, carbonate, oxide, organic, sulfide and residue forms. Many procedures of sequential extraction of sample e.g. soil, bottom sediments and fly ash were described, which include group extraction of metals to solution.\nApplied procedures of sequential extraction concern of group extraction of metals and doesn't selective for individual metals.

Some researchers think, that biological activity of flavonoids is connected with their complexation capacity. Therapeutic action can show both the molecule and its metabolite. The application of quercetin and morin is restricted due to their insolubility in water. Their sulfonic derivatives are well soluble in water and show biological activity as their mother compounds.

            "abstract": "In this article the theoretical basis of capillary electrochromatography are presented, as well as some of its analytical applications. The historical background of this analytical method is briefly outlined. The nature of Helmholtz and Stern double layer at the phase boundary resulting in the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and the equations describing its velocity are shortly discussed. From these equations it follows that EOF depends on the properties of liquid phase (a ratio of dielectric constant to viscosity), the electric field intensity and the electric double layer (\u03c2 potential) but does not depend on the diameter of particles of column or capillary packing. The relationship between EOF and efficiency of the chromatographic system is discussed and some advantages and disadvantages of electrochromatography are mentioned.\nThe columns (capillaries) used in electrochromatography (packed, open tubular and monolytic) are described.\nThe applications of capillary electrochromatography described here encompass enantioselective analysis and separation of mixtures of analytes. The examples of enantioseparations deal mainly with drugs, whereas electrochromatographic separations of mixtures are exemplified by amino acids, peptides, proteins and some groups of drugs (barbiturates and benzodiazepines).\nIt is concluded that electrochromatography, although relatively .young. analytical method, found important applications and is in the phase of constant development.",

            "abstract": "Homeopathy is an alternative medicine system that uses ultra-low doses of substances derived from plants, minerals, or animals for the purpose of stimulating the natural healing response of the body. There are two central tenets, on which homeopathy is based: the law of similars and potentization (dilution and shaking) [1].\nDespite conventional science.s unwillingness to grant homeopathy a&nbsp;serious platform, it is difficult to ignore a&nbsp;subject that has survived 200 years of scientific skepticism and is more and more popular alternative system of medicine [2-4]. Two main questions, however, accompany the whole history of this complementary method: are homeopathic remedies really effective? And if it is true: what is a&nbsp;mechanism of the homeopathic effects?\nHomeopathy remedies are prepared in a&nbsp;very specific manner. The original substance, called mother tincture, is progressively diluted in a&nbsp;solvent (water, ethanol) and .potentized. by violent shaking between each dilution. It is obvious that after a&nbsp;definite number of dilutions the obtained solution is statistically unlikely to contain a&nbsp;single molecule of the original compound. Such solutions are called ultra-highly diluted (UHD) solutions. Looking for a&nbsp;scientific basis of homeopathy, it is very important to distinguish between remedies containing a&nbsp;low but real dose of the original substance, for which their efficacy is within the limits of what is today.s knowledge, and remedies without molecules of the original compounds (UHD solutions), of which effects (if so) are beyond our understanding.\nResearch on the UHD solutions can roughly be classified into three topics [11]. The first concerns clinical investigations on efficacy of homeopathic remedies and their comparison with placebo. Although a&nbsp;lot of trials and meta-analysis have been performed, the general conclusion is totally ambiguous [35-45] (Fig. 1). The latest reports [304], however, strongly support the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are placebo effects. The second topic includes laboratory research on the biological effects, sometimes called preclinical research. The best-known and the most controversial at the same time results were published in 1988 by Benveniste [47] (Fig. 2), a&nbsp;once highly respected immunologist, that advocated the existence of biological effects of UHD solutions. Since then numerous experiments have been carried out on laboratory biological systems [71] (e.g. Fig. 3). Unfortunately, these studies, just as in the case of clinical research, are far from giving incontrovertible evidence for the UHD effects. Finally, the third research topic, which makes the main subject of this paper, is focused on physical, chemical and physicochemical investigations of the UHD solutions. In general, all these investigations are based on the water memory hypothesis [48-50] and concentrate on the search for physicochemical differences between the UHD solutions and their \"pure\" solvents.\nThe authors of this paper present herein all published more significant results concerning physicochemical studies carried out on the UHD solutions and undertake an attempt to answer a&nbsp;question, namely whether there is any evidence, on the basis of these results, that can explicitly prove the water memory effect. The results are collected in a&nbsp;few sections according to physicochemical phenomena. The first of these sections (Section 4.2) is devoted to UV-VIS spectroscopy, and investigations of photoabsorption [97-101], photoluminescence [106.109] and thermoluminescence [111-114] are discussed. Examples of these results are shown in Figs. 4-7. Than the studies of \"pure\" water and the UHD solutions by IR [115-128] (Figs. 8,9) and Raman [109, 116, 125, 129-143] (Fig. 10) spectroscopies are presented. The next section includes findings that are related to NMR spectroscopy. NMR has turned out to be a&nbsp;very useful technique to study of dynamic properties of liquid water [145-147]. Although the earlier tests showed evident differences between various UHD solutions and their solvents [148-155, 158] (Fig. 11), the recent investigations are not so optimistic giving negative replications [159, 160, 162] (Fig. 12). It indicates that the previous NMR results should be thoroughly revisited. Similarly, reanalysis of the results concerning thermodynamic study, described in the Section 4.5, is also desirable. These investigations were carried out only by one research team from University of Naples [166-169] and it has not been replicated by other laboratories as yet. The problem consists in measurements of the heats of mixing of acid or basic solutions with various UHD solutions (Fig. 13). In this paper it is suggested that these results, which are connected by the researchers from Naples with the water memory effect, can be explained another, more .conventional. way [170-172].\nA large proportion of the work is devoted to electrical properties of the UHD solutions and its comparison to pure water and conventional solutions. In this section (Section 4.6), measurements of the electrical conductivity and capacitance [126, 183-193] (Figs. 14,15), electrical breakdowns [196-199], corona discharges [202-204] (Fig. 16), and electrochemical processes [205-210] (Fig. 17) are discussed. It is shown that also in this case we can propose the explanation of the observed effects without invoking the water memory hypothesis. In the last part of the sections, in which we can familiarize with physicochemical investigations on the UHD solutions, very questionable measurements of molecular signals and their transmission by electromagnetic means are reported [213-223, 228-230] (Fig. 18). This issue is closely connected with \"digital biology\" - a&nbsp;new controversial field of science [212].\nSummarizing the mentioned above results of physicochemical investigations we can come to a&nbsp;conclusion that without any doubt in many instances the differences in properties between UHD solutions and their solvents exist. In the light of this fact the crucial problem emerges: is it possible to explain these differences by \"conventional\" causes or we have to create a&nbsp;new idea that will transform the face of the science? In Sec. 5 we collect both hypotheses based on well-known phenomena (Sec. 5.1), for example ion extraction from the glass during shaking [109, 233, 234], gas dissolving [95, 170-172, 189, 227, 235-240], native impurities of solvents [162, 241-250] (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 19), mechano-catalytic processes [253, 254], heterogeneity of solutions [255-260], and new but disputed hypotheses (Sec. 5.2) originated from the general conception of water memory [19, 48-50, 74, 158, 252, 261-267, 279-292]. It is shown in the paper that the latter hypotheses do not hold up to criticism provided by the modern established knowledge [77, 78, 80, 83, 117, 268-278]. It is also concluded that today there is no reason to construct groundbreaking theories and the observed phenomena can be explained by \"conventional\" way. It is very important to remember the following Aristotle's thought: if we want to accept any truth as the scientific knowledge, it must originate from other truths.",

Synthetically useful organic reactions of substrates immobilized on solid supports constitute a&nbsp;central part of the methodology of solid phase synthesis. This review article presents a&nbsp;representative and fairly comprehensive overview of reactions of supported substrates published till January 2005. The reactions are classified in synthetic terms into functional group interconvertions (FGI, according to type of functional group reacting and prepared) and C-C bond forming reactions (according to reaction type; usually name reaction). In particular preparations of halogens, alcohols, ethers, thiols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, amides, phosphines, amines, poliamines, peptides, peptoids, oligonucleotides, and oligosaccharides is covered. Oxidation reactions of alcohols, aldehydes and ketones as well as reduction reactions of aldehydes, ketones, esters, acids, nitro and nitroso compounds are also presented. Only the selected reactions used for preparation of oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides, and polypeptides are covered due to the large volume of literature on this topic. The important C-C bond forming reactions such as Mannich, Michael, aldol, Heck, Suzuki, Stille, Sonogashira, Wittig, Horner-Wadsworth- Emmons, metathesis, carbonyl compound alkylation and acylation reactions are illustrated with examples. Moreover the multicomponent reactions such as Ugi reaction, Hantzsch reaction and Baylis-Hillman reaction are also included in the review.\nThe literature review shows a&nbsp;spectrum of synthetic organic reactions which can be performed on the immobilized substrates and suggests that in principle every reaction could be performed on solid phase. However the literature review indicates that reactions of polar organometallic reagents, radical reactions, and enantioselective reactions of achiral immobilized substrates are rather rarely used in SPOS.",

Respective data are presented in Table 1 [1-4].\nBecause of radiochemical properties of 90Sr, analysis of its concentration is very difficult. The whole process comprises laborious stages: isolation of the isotope from the sample, removing contamination, elimination of the decay product (90Y) and radioactivity measurement.\nMany analytical methods have been presented in literature for years. Generally, one can divide them in two groups: fast [6-12] and standard [14-34].\nFast methods, (from several hours to a&nbsp;few days) are mostly applied to .fresh. samples (immediately after radioactive fall-out) containing 89Sr and 91Y beside 90Sr and 90Y.

The mostly encountered analytical problems are: sample dissolution, removal of calcium and iron ions, removing primary/parental isotopes of radium, thorium, actinium and lead.\nMethods for 90Sr-90Y separation (liquid-liquid and solid-liquid extraction) are well known and broadly presented in literature [6-10, 30-34]. Those methods used to determine concentration of radioactive 90Sr in environmental samples. a&nbsp;skilled radioanalyst may modify them according to the needed procedure, which is described in present paper.",

            "abstract": "Formaldehyde is known to be ubiquitous pollutant in an atmospheric environment. It enters the atmosphere from natural processes such as: biomass combustion, metabolic processes and from direct human sources -fuel combustion (automotive, power plants and waste incinerators) and industrial emissions (occurring during production, use and storage of formaldehyde). Formaldehyde is also formed in photochemical oxidation of methane and other volatile organic compounds including natural and anthropogenic ones, like: alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes and alcohols [6, 16]. Acting as a&nbsp;source of radicals in the atmosphere and precursor of ozone, peroxyacetyl nitrate and nitric acid formation, formaldehyde is an important contributor to photochemical smog in urban air [7, 10, 20, 21].\nAlthough natural direct emissions and secondary production seem to be larger than direct anthropogenic releases, the highest levels of formaldehyde concentrations occur near anthropogenic sources. Concentrations of formaldehyde in clean rural air are usually below 1,5 \u03bcg/m3 and about 20 \u03bcg/m3 in urban areas [3].\nFormaldehyde is a&nbsp;major intermediate product in chemical manufacturing. Its main uses are the production of phenolic, urea, melamine and polyacetals resins, which are widely used as adhesives and binders in wood, textile, pulp and paper industries. Formaldehyde is also used as a&nbsp;preservative, disinfecting and cleaning agent in many products used in daily life. Building, decorating and insulating materials, furniture, wooden floors, carpets and textile garments are significant formaldehyde emissions sources in indoor areas. In addition formaldehyde in homes is released (about 10-30%) from combustion processes (tobacco smoking, fireplaces and furnaces). Due to the widespread distribution of formaldehyde sources in houses, average levels of its concentrations in indoor air are 20-60 \u03bcg/m3 and are usually evaluated according to limits of formaldehyde concentration [3, 11, 16, 22].\nFormaldehyde even at low exposure levels causes burning sensations in the eyes, nose and throat, and contributes to sick house syndrome. Long-term exposure induces sensitization to formaldehyde which may develop an allergic reaction. Formaldehyde was a&nbsp;suspected carcinogen and an established 2A group in the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification system until 2004, when the working group of IARC reclassified it as a&nbsp;human carcinogen (1G) [3, 4].\nAccording to the toxicity and exposure levels of formaldehyde, there is the necessity to take measures to reduce formaldehyde concentrations in indoor air. There are some simple ways of limiting its emission, i.e. buying wood products, furniture and decorating materials with low formaldehyde content, ensuring adequate ventilation, temperature moderation and reduction of humidity levels [22]. The most effective solution is air cleaning which is recently becoming more popular. There are some general methods of air purification like adsorption of formaldehyde on activated carbon or other adsorbents with functional groups reactive to formaldehyde (usually primary and secondary amine groups) [48-65], and an alternative technique-oxidation, including: heterogonous catalytic oxidation with air, photocatalytic degradation and oxidation of formaldehyde using potassium permanganate filters [76-91].",

Decomposition of solid samples (plant material) is an important step in combined analytical methods. In most cases, when using highly sensitive measuring methods, such as flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), graphite furnace AAS, ICPAES, ICP-MS, the sample is measured in an aqueous solution. Combined analytical methods are favoured for multi element analysis of botanical samples at very high speed. Sequential and simultaneous determinations of the elements can be made using the above analytical techniques.\nA wide range of microwave digestion procedures for plant tissues has been used such as dry ashing, open vessel digestion, microwave dissolution and acid bomb digestion, etc. Although these procedures generally show both good accuracy and precision, some of them are rather time-consuming. Several factors should be considered while preparing samples for analyses. These may include the level of contamination, having homogenous samples, reproducibility and completeness of the digestion, suitability for the analysis technique, time needed for sample preparation and economic aspects, etc.",

This review presents basic definitions of asymmetric synthesis and currently used concepts for enatioselective and diastereoselective transformations involving supported synthesis. The concepts of chiral auxiliary, chiral catalyst and chiral reagent are illustrated with selected but fairly comprehensive overview of methods published till January 2005. In particular use of chiral auxiliaries such as oxazolidine derivatives, amines, hydrazines, sulfoxides, sulfinyl amides, sulfoxy imines, carbohydrates and alcohols is covered. Applications of immobilized chiral catalysts to synthesis of carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-hydrogen bonds, carbon-heteroatom bonds and in phase-transfer catalysis is presented with selected reactions due to huge volume of literature in this field. Moreover applications of chiral catalysts and chiral reagents in reactions of immobilized substrates and use of chiral immobilized reagents is also reviewed. The literature review shows that the most popular methods of supported asymmetric synthesis are the alkylation of enolates, aldol reactions, Grignard reactions, cycloadditions, reduction of ketones, epoxidations, olefin dihydroxylation, and phase-transfer catalyzed reactions. There are numerous applications of immobilized chiral catalysts and a&nbsp;substantial number of applications of immobilized chiral auxiliaries. On the other hand there are only scarce reports of applications of chiral reagents and chiral catalysts to the reactions of achiral immobilized substrates.\nKeywords: Solid-phase synthesis, asymmetric synthesis, polymer supported reaction, combinatorial chemistry, organic synthesis.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Leprosy is a&nbsp;chronic infectious disease, that is caused by a&nbsp;bacillus of Mycobacterium leprae. It was considered to be an incurable disease for ages. Nowadays leprosy is a&nbsp;vanishing disease although you can meet it principally in the tropical zone countries [3-8]. Since times immemorial, the natural origin preparations had been involved under the leprosy treatment. One of them was chaulmoogra, the oil isolated from seeds of: Hydnocarpus kurzii, the gorli tree - Oncoba echinata and Carpotroche brasiliensis plant [14]. The main components of the chaulmoogra oil are triglicerides of hydnocarpic acid (1), chaulmoogric acid (2) as well as gorlic (3) [16, 18, 19]. In 1921 year , ethyl esters of named above acids were applied successfully in the leprosy treatment [23]. Other natural origin components also reveal leprostatic effectiveness. There are derivatives of boswelin acid 4, 5 which have been found in the Boswelia serrata plant [19, 29, 30].\nThe first and effectively applied antileprosy drug up today, occured Dapsone (6), which was introduced in the leprosy therapy in 1946 year [12]. This medicine has appeared comparatively little toxic, inexpensive and effective at all forms of leprosy [12, 32, 33].\nA great number of Dapsone (6) derivatives have been received lately. Most of them have been introduced to the therapy of leprosy and other bacterial diseases (Table 3).\nThe next group of derivatives of Dapsone (6) composes the ones, with substitutions in the phenyl ring 15. Such combinations are received in result of a&nbsp;multistage synthesis (Scheme 3).\nThere have been still lasting experiments above receiving new active sulfones in relation to bacillus of Mycobacterium leprae [53]. Among sulfones not being derivatives of Dapsone (6) Promizole (19) has been found and applied in the leprosy therapy [31]. The method of its synthesis has been introduced on Scheme 4.\nExcept sulfones, sulfonamides are also employed in the leprosy therapy, in spite that theirs activity in relation to Mycobacterium leprae is small [3, 32, 55, 56]. After all, Sulfomethoxazole (22) gives good therapeutic results 22 in connection with Trimethoprim (24). These connections are being utilised in a&nbsp;multidrug, antileprosy therapy [57]. There are a&nbsp;few methods of receiving of Sulfomethoxazole (22) (Schema 5) and Trimethoprim (24) (Schemes 6-8) [58-68].\nThe derivatives of Trimethoprim (24), Brodimoprim (35) and Epiroprim (36) have been received by the Swiss. Hoffmann-La-Roche Ltd Company and they are likely to be used in the multidrug antileprosy therapy [69-74].\nIt has been taken an advantage in the leprosy treatment of using derivatives of thiocarbamide - Tiambutazyne (37) and Thiocarlide (38). However the need to engage them in large doses is the basic defect of these medicines [55, 75]. Tiambutozyne (37) has being received as a&nbsp;result of the p-amine-N,N-dimethylaniline reaction witch p-propoxyphenylisothiocyanate (Scheme 9), however Thiocarlide (38) synthesis depends on the 4-(3-methylbutoxy)aniline reaction with carbon disuflide (Scheme 10) [76-77].\nThere are also some amides e.g. Ethionamide (40a), Prothionamide (40b) as well as Pyrazinamide (51) which produce a&nbsp;good antileprosy influence.\nThese medicines have found the application mainly in the tuberculosis treatment, though in the antileprosy therapy either [24]. The method of synthesis of Ethionamide (40a) and Prothionamide (40b) has been presented on Scheme 11.\nStill, the experiments on new effective working antileprosy combinations have been carrying out. According to results, good antileprous proprieties have characterized the derivatives of thiazolidine (42) and thiocarbamide (39) [77, 79, 84]. Searching for new antileprosy medicines have still been led in the sulfons and sulfonamides groups [85-86]. a&nbsp;number of new medicines has entered the therapy of leprosy at present and among others there are chiefly ansamycin, chinolones and ketholides antibiotics. However Dapsone has still been fulfilling the most important part 6, which for over of 60 years continually has been determining the basic antileprosy medicine.\nKeywords: antileprosy drug, lepra, Mycobacterium leprae, Dapson",

Microtubules are hollow tubes consisting of ?- and ?-tubulin heterodimer proteins that polymerize parallelly to a&nbsp;cylindrical axis [75]. The targeting of microtubules is an important mechanism in cancer chemotherapy for such drugs as the vinca alkaloids (vincristine 1, vinblastine 1a), podophilotoxin, their semisynthetic analogues and taxanes (paclitaxel 2, docetaxel 3) (Fig. 1) known of their great usefulness in the anticancer therapy [7,75]. These agents may stabilize microtubules, as the taxanes do, or destabilize them, as it is in the case of the vinca alkaloids. Today, more than 30 compounds targeting tubulin, either stabilizing or destabilizing microtubule dynamics, are in late preclinical or early clinical development. Despite of more than 30 years after the discovery of paclitaxel microtubule inhibitors they are still of the topic of interest of all over the world.\nIn the end of 1990 and up to 2005 year survey articles on the microtubule inhibitors were published [7-12].

            "abstract": "Ammonium nitrate (AN) is one of the most popular synthetic chemicals in the world, produced in quantity of a&nbsp;few dozen millions tons every year. The main application of AN is as a&nbsp;nitrogen containing fertilizer in agriculture. The second large use, but in a&nbsp;much minor scale, is as an essential ingredient for manufacturing AN based explosive for mining industry. In both application AN is used in a&nbsp;granular or prilled form. Granules/prills of commercial AN of dimension from 1 mm to 5 mm reveal much better exploitation properties than other form (grains, crystals). Granulated/prilled AN characterizes excellent flow ability what make easier final manufacturing operations and usage. Granulated/prilled form of AN also posses a&nbsp;relatively higher resistance to caking - the main disadvantage of many fertilizers.\nThe history of large scale production of AN started in the beginning of XX century. Till those times, AN was regarded as a&nbsp;moderate oxidizer, without explosive features as a&nbsp;pure compound. Huge industrial catastrophes in Germany in 1921 caused by unexpected explosions of large amount of AN were the reason to change radically the opinion concerning the safety of the chemical. Massive explosions of AN still take place nowadays during production processes, transportation and storage, even in highly technologically advanced countries (USA, France).\nSince the last few decades AN in a&nbsp;form of porous prills/granules is used for manufacturing the most popular explosive in mining industry. Porous AN saturated with 5-6 % of fuel oil is relatively powerful, safe in handling and the cheapest tool for crushing mineral deposits. The explosive is called ANFO what origins from the acronym of ingredients. Explosive properties of AN and its mixtures are well known by world-wide net of terrorist groups. In the last dozen years about hundred terrorist attacks have been performed using large weight bombs consist mainly of easy available mining grade or fertilizer AN. The pattern to prepare bomb attacks is the criminal case which took place in Oklahoma City (USA, 1995), where federal skyscraper was ruined by explosion of 2 tons AN charge killing 170 persons and wounding hundreds people.\nThe scientific and technological problem is to produce AN of two grades. First, as a&nbsp;fertilizer with no limitation in purchasing, should characterize full resistance to explosion and without potential ability to make explosive mixture with other additives. The second, as a&nbsp;raw material for manufacturing ANFO, it should be available only for professionals which posses appropriate permission and because such a&nbsp;product itself is an explosive material with all limitations in transportation, storage and handling.\nIn the paper the review of huge industrial catastrophes as well as terrorist attacks caused by explosion of AN were done. The physical properties of AN used as a&nbsp;fertilizer in agriculture and as an ingredient for manufacturing of mining explosives were described.\nKeywords: ammonium nitrate, ANFO, industrial explosion, bomb attack",

            "abstract": "The use of microwave energy in sample treatments has attracted growing interest in the past few years. Initially, it was applied to the mineralization of samples. In recent years, numerous applications have reported the use of microwaves for assisting the extraction of organic compounds and organometallic compounds form various environmental matrices. In fact, the use of microwave energy to aid organic extraction was first achieved using conventional household systems in the late 1980s. Thus, in the past few years, numerous compounds have been extracted by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) from several matrices, with special emphasis on environmental applications.\nMicrowave-assisted extraction (MAE) is a&nbsp;process of using microwave energy to heat solvents in contact with a&nbsp;sample in order to partition analytes from the sample matrix into the solvent. The ability to rapidly heat the sample solvent mixture is inherent to MAE and the main advantage of this technique. By using closed vessels the extraction can be performed at elevated temperatures accelerating the mass transfer of target compounds from the sample matrix. a&nbsp;typical extraction procedure takes 15-30 min and uses small solvent volumes in the range of 10-30 ml. These volumes are about 10 times smaller than volumes used by conventional extraction techniques. In addition, sample throughput is increased as several samples can be extracted simultaneously. In most cases recoveries of analytes and reproducibility are improved compared to conventional techniques, as shown in several applications. This review gives a&nbsp;brief theoretical background of microwave heating and the basic principles of using microwave energy for extraction. It also attempts to summarize all studies performed on closed-vessel MAE until now. The influences of parameters such as solvent choice, solvent volume, temperature, time and matrix characteristics (including water content) are discussed.\nThis article reviews the application of microwave energy to the extraction of organic and organometallic compounds from environmental samples, namely: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticide, phenol, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins.\nKeywords: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), sample of environment, PCB, PAH, dioxins",

            "abstract": "Determination of the electric dipolar moment of a&nbsp;molecule is one of the most important procedures applied to characterize the molecule spectral activity, type of the chemical bonds between atoms forming the molecule and its geometry [1, 2]. Electric dipolar moment can be determined by making use of the Stark or Zeeman effects, quantum-mechanical ab initio calculations or from highly resolved MW and IR rotation-vibrational spectra using spectroscopic methods. Each of the methods mentioned has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the Stark method cannot be applied to molecular ions as under external electric field they are accelerated towards the wall of the discharge tube. In 1955 Townes et al. [5], developed the method of determination of the dipolar moment using the Zeeman effect. This approach has been generalized in 1987 by Laughlin et al. [6], and applied to ArH+ cation. They obtained the values: 1.4(4) D [6], 1.59(40) D [7] and 3.0(6) D [8], which seriously differed from the ab initio result 2.2(1) D provided by Rosmus in 1979 [10]. The additional ab initio calculations performed by Pyykk\u00f6 et al. [11], and then by Geertsen and Scuseria [12] in 1989, confirmed the correctness of the result obtained earlier by Rosmus. In such circumstances only the application of a&nbsp;third independent method could provide a&nbsp;correct value of the electric dipolar moment of ArH+. Following this suggestion, Molski [26] in 2001 applied the spectroscopic method to evaluate dipolar moment of ArH+ from highly resolved MW and IR spectra including pure rotational and vibration-rotational lines. The result obtained 2.12(55) D confirmed that ab initio calculations provided a&nbsp;reliable value of the dipolar moment of ArH+, whereas the experimental values obtained by Laughlin et al., were less accurate. The supplementary calculations performed for KrH+ [27] and HeH+ [29] indicate that the method of Laughlin et al. [6, 7, 8] does not produce reliable values of the electric dipolar moment for diatomic ions, whereas for polyatomic molecules this method is reliable [15, 16].\nKeywords: electric dipolar moment, Lande factor, diatomic molecules, Stark effect, Zeeman effect, IR and MW spectra",

It is divided into several chapters including synthesis, structural and spectroscopic (NMR) characterization followed by reactivity and catalytic properties of some novel compounds. Metal complexes with boroxide ligands can generally be defined as derivatives of hydroxydiorganoboranes R2BOH or dihydroxyorganoboranes RB(OH)2, where one or two hydrogen atoms are replaced with a&nbsp;metal. a&nbsp;few complexes with a&nbsp;closely related R2B2O32- ligand derived from triorganoboroxin [RBO]3 have also been included. Boroxide ligands may be regarded as electrondefficient analogues of alkoxide ligands, due to specific electronic properties of a&nbsp;trivalent boron atom, which is able to interact by means of its 2p orbital with a&nbsp;lone electron pair of an adjacent oxygen atom. As a&nbsp;result of this so-called back-bonding, the B-O bond order is increased, whereas the \u03c0-donor properties of oxygen are reduced. Accordingly, a&nbsp;metaloxygen bond is weakened. Another important point is that boroxides are sterically less crowding than bulky aryloxide ligands having comparable electronic properties. Hence, an increased reactivity of such complexes is expected, especially as catalysts or initiators in various polymerization processes.\nKeywords: boroxide ligands, metal alkoxides, hydroxyorganoboranes, polymerization",

The group of these components have a&nbsp;big influence on a&nbsp;present medicine. Among components, that were presented in this paper, many number of them show antineoplastic activity. These peptidyl anthraquinones demonstrate special mechanism of action, stabilizing cleavable complex consisting of topoisomerase, convalently attached to DNA and stop correct replication and transcription. Using of topoisomerases inhibitors (11a,c,d, 73l,m) (Figure 2 and Scheme 9) in therapy of cancer have promising results [18, 26-28]. Anthraquinones analogues with peptidyl chain (78a-h) (Scheme 10) including KCR motif very important in AP-1 protein binding to DNA. This group of compounds can be used as potential transcription factor inhibitors, because they show DNA intercalative binding and recognize specific sequences of DNA binding domains [48-54]. Synthetic GnRH analogues including rings of anthraquinone (69a,b) (Scheme 8) present interesting drugs using in reproductive diseases, for instance prostate, ovarian and breast cancer. The mechanism of action of GnRH analogues count on binding to GnRH receptors, which we can find in cells of reproductive organs [45, 46]. MMP-9 activity can be exploited to activate prodrugs and be a&nbsp;target the tumour cells in BM. Cleavage of the prodrugs (66, 67a,b) (Figure 3) with MMP-9 resulsts in the liberation of the active form of drug which can be an inhibitor of topoisomerase. Tripeptide derivatives of anthraquinone (22, 33, 40) (Scheme 2, Scheme 3) show the activity as histochemical reagents for detection of TTP i&nbsp;activity [38-44].

            "abstract": "DNA sequences with stretches of multiple guanines can form four-stranded tetraplex DNA structures called guanine-quadruplexes or G4 DNA. They contain stacked arrays of planar guanine quartets linked by connecting loops (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Evidence supports the occurrence of quadruplexes in the cell nucleus and a&nbsp;number of biological functions have been attributed to quadruplexes. In eukaryotic systems guanine-rich sequences are positioned at the ends of chromosomes and are called telomeric DNA. The study of telomeric DNA has acquired importance through the discovery of the relationship between telomerase activity in most cancer cells and telomere folding into tetraplex structure. Coordination of certain metal cations stabilizes G-quadruplex as do some promising small organic molecules, which are regarded as potential anticancer drugs. Among many techniques employed to explore properties of G-quadruplexes, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been recognized as a&nbsp;powerful tool to explore tetraplex formation due to extreme sensitivity and the distance dependency of the FRET process.\nThis review shows how FRET contributes to G-quadruplex research and focuses on the FRET application, describing briefly also the underlying principles. Information about molecular structure, binding events, and motion are considered to be potentially available from FRET measurements. In a&nbsp;typical FRET experiment a&nbsp;guanine-rich oligonucleotide labeled with proper fluorophores (FRET donor and acceptor) undergoes structural transformations (folding or unfolding), which are monitored by spectral changes in the fluorescence spectra of FRET partners. We tried to summarize the current developments in the field of the various applications of FRET measurements for the fundamental structural and kinetic investigations of G-quadruplexes and their complexes with metal cations and organic ligands. Fundamental applications include studies of quadruplex unfolding kinetics with the use of complementary DNA or PNA (Peptide Nucleic Acid) strands as a&nbsp;duplex trap or determination of thermodynamic parameters. Practical applications are illustrated by the FRET-based selection of quadruplex-binding ligands, construction of the quadruplex-based nanomotor, design of molecular probes for protein recognition, and development of sensors for the detection of potassium ions in aqueous media.\nThe presented examples of FRET studies showed that FRET is particularly useful in structural studies of oligonucleotides capable of folding into tetraplex structure.\nKeywords: Fluorescence; Fluorescence Energy Transfer (FRET); G-quadruplex; Proteins; Quadruplex-binding ligands; Telomeric DNA; Tetraplex DNA structure; Thrombin Binding Aptamer (TBA)",

This is an integral component of the outer membrane of the wall. Salmonella smooth (S) forms produce LPS, which is composed of three parts, chemically bonded together viz. polysaccharide O-antigen, oligosaccharide core region and lipid a&nbsp;[103]. Antigens o&nbsp;(O-PS) together with H flagella antigens are the foundation of serological classification of these bacteria. O-chain, which is built with up to 50 oligosaccharide repeating units, is one of the products of mild acidic hydrolysis of LPS. Due to the fact that polysaccharide antigens are the sites of specific antibody complexing, any difference in primary and secondary structures of O-antigens reflect serological specificity of bacteria. Taking this fact into consideration, we can distinguish about 2541 Salmonella serotypes with o&nbsp;and H antigenic formulas defined [4]. In this review we present 55 chemical structures of O-antigenic repeating units of Salmonella strains (Tab. 3) including their heterogeneity structures [54, 74, 75, 99]. The structures can have 22 different monosaccharide residues usually in 3 to 6 sugar repeating units. We describe here selected chemical and spectroscopic (MS, NMR) methods for primary structure examination of these bacterial O-PS. Enzymatic and immunochemical methods are also described. Cross-reactions of Salmonella spp. with any other bacteria [16, 17] or blood group A, B, 0 antigens [27, 51, 123] are explained on the molecular level.\nThus, structural assignments of somatic antigens of Salmonella spp. allow us to understand the molecular level of the classification system of these bacteria.\nKeywords: O-antigens, Salmonella, primary structure, spectroscopic methods (MS, NMR)",

Electroanalytical techniques have been frequently used in monitoring the changes of environment.

Electrochemistry has been also very useful in developing and in the production of new energy sources. a&nbsp;lot of attention has been paid to studies of environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel cells. The electrochemical techniques of waste degradation can be divided into two main categories: (i) techniques based on the faradaic processes of oxidation or reduction of contamination, and (ii) electrokinetic methods based on the transport of ions or charged particles in the electric field. The electrode processes result in the formation of deposits on the electrode surface or the decomposition of large organic molecules to the low molecular weight, easily biodegradable molecules or CO2. The electrokinetic techniques include electrocoagulation, electroosmosis, electrodialysis, and electroflotation. These techniques are widely used in removing contaminants from soil.

In 1998, 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (DADNE) was synthesized by N. Latypov et al. using destructive nitration of heterocyclic compounds containing the structural element of acetamidine. Soon it turned out that this comparatively simple structure, which can be synthesized without difficulties, possesses very favorable functional qualities as an explosive.\nThe structure of DADNE molecule is conducive to creation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and this makes DADNE a&nbsp;very stable (activation energy of 243 kJ/mole), thermally resistant (decomposition above 200<sup>o</sup>C) and dense substance (1.787 g/cm3). DADNE has favorable oxygen balance and on decomposition the molecule can produce entirely gaseous products (CO, H2O, N2) in the amount of ca. 900 cm3/g. Consequently the performance of DADNE almost equals to the common high explosive RDX (1,3,5-triaza-1,3,5-trinitrocyclohexane), but its sensitivity is comparable with that of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene). Other advantages of DADNE include excellent compatibility with typical components of explosive formulations and propellants as well as ability to be pressed into mechanically resistant pellets without any additives. The already known properties of DADNE indicate that it can be used on its own or in formulations as a&nbsp;high explosive or propellant component.

            "abstract": "Combustion synthesis or self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) is a&nbsp;well established method for preparation of many valuable compounds such as: refractory compounds (borides, carbides, nitrides, silicides), oxides (tanthalates, niobates, ferrites, cuprates), intermetallics (aluminides, germanides, nickelides) chalcogenides (sulphides, selenides, tellurides), phosphides, hydrides, and some others. The applications of these compounds can be classified as: cutting tools and polishing powders, resistive heating elements, shape-memory alloys, electrodes, coatings and thin films. Some SHS technologies have found their industrial applications. In Russia, USA and Japan, the SHS powders of inorganic compounds, ceramic insulators, high temperature heaters, shape memory alloy wire, cutting inserts, etc, are produced on an industrial scale. However, it was thought that only large particles (several microns and above) could be obtained by the SHS method [1-3].\nIt was found recently (Nersisyan et al., 2003-2005), that if the reaction occurs in a&nbsp;medium of molten salt (basically alkali metal halide) and has moderate exothermicity, nanometric size titanium carbide and some of transition metals (Ti, Ta, Nb, Mo) could be obtained by utilization of SHS method. Moreover Huczko at al. (2005) reported that silicon carbide single-crystals in the form of nanofibers and spherical multi-walled carbon nanoparticles and encapsulates could be prepared through the defluorination of poly(tetrafluoroethene) with silicon-containing precursors using the combustion synthesis route. Finally, in 2005, Koch published complete results of a&nbsp;thermodynamic analysis of self-sustaining reaction of fluorinated graphite with magnesium, and reported on detection of single walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nano carpet rolls in the combustion products. This discovery of great importance was patented as a&nbsp;new method of synthesis of carbon allotropes (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) and various carbon encapsulates. Undoubtedly, it has been demonstrated that SHS offers great potential for generating nanomaterials, including 1D inorganic and carbon nonostructures.\nIn this review, we discuss the recent developments in the field of combustion synthesis, with special emphasis on the preparation of nanomaterials by low-temperature combustion synthesis (LCS), reductive dehalogenation of halocarbons, and sol-gel combustion synthesis (SCS).

            "abstract": "The strategy of modification in chemical processes in order to ensure a&nbsp;safer, cleaner environment in the future is one of the main goal of green chemistry. The basic twelve principles of green chemistry were formulated by P. Anastas and J.Warner in 1998 and accepted by society. Following these principles chemists designing a&nbsp;new process should pay special attention to select substrates and chemicals that minimize their harm to the environment and to human health. Also existing chemical technologies should be modified in a&nbsp;similar way. One approach to achieve this goal is replacement of traditional toxic solvents (mainly VOC,s volatile organic solvents) with ionic liquids presenting a&nbsp;group of liquids or low-temperature melting solid salts of no vapour pressure. Application of ionic liquids in processes catalyzed by transition metal complexes meets two (or in some cases even three) green chemistry rules. The presence of ionic liquids as a&nbsp;solvent in catalytic systems for C-C bond forming reactions like Heck, Sonogashira, Suzuki and carbonylation offers many spectacular advantages including facilitation of catalyst separation from organic products. Elimination even traces of metals from the products of C-C coupling reactions which are used as medicines or agricultural chemicals is extremely important. An article presents catalytic systems containing palladium catalyst precursors, both soluble and heterogenized complexes as well as palladium nanocolloids applied in C-C bond forming processes performed in ionic liquids. The applicability of ionic liquids and influence of their molecular structure on the reaction course is discussed. a&nbsp;special attention is paid to the reactions of ionic liquids with palladium precursors leading to the formation of new species and modification of catalytic properties of the system. It is shown that in many catalytic systems a&nbsp;strong inhibiting effect of imidazolium halides was observed. This fact can be explain on the basis of experimental data by the reaction of imidazolium halide with palladium - aryl intermediate leading to N-heterocyclic carbene complex of lower catalytic activity. Decomposition of palladium - aryl intermediates with formation of phosphonium salts in the presence of imidazolium halide was also observed. In both above mentioned cases a&nbsp;key intermediate in C-C bond forming reactions, that is palladium - aryl halide complex, is eliminated from the reaction mixture causing to decrease of the final product yield.\nAn article presents a&nbsp;state of knowledge in the field of ionic liquids application in catalysis and formulates expectations for future designing of catalytically active and environmentally friendly palladium based systems for C-C bond forming reactions.

            "abstract": "Influenza (flu) and related viral infections present a&nbsp;constant threat to public health. World-wide efforts have been recently initiated (coordinated by WHO) to prevent global epidemic in view of spreading deadly bird flu virus (H5N1) among people [1, 6]. Attention has been focused on Tamiflu\u00ae (1, Figure 1), synthetic, orally active drug manufactured by Hoffmann - La Roche [12].\nOn the surface of the flu virus (Figure 3) there are located two proteins important for infecting animal cell: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (sialidase). Hemagglutinin is responsible for the recognition of specific sialic acids in the cell membrane glycoconjugates; neuraminidase is involved in subsequent hydrolysis of sialic acid residue and is crucial for the virus propagation. Sialic acids are sugar-related keto-acids, as neuraminic acid 2 (Figure 2). Their structure is specific for a&nbsp;given species. Functions of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase have been targeted in systematic search for anti-flu drugs.\nThe first efficient neuraminidase competitive inhibitor Relanza\u00ae (Zanamivir) has been obtained (Scheme 2) as a&nbsp;mimic of hypothetic oxonium ion involved in sialic acid hydrolysis [11, 15]. Many structures related to Zanamivir have been investigated [19]. The most successful line of research has been aimed at synthesis of carbocyclic neuraminic acid derivatives from (-)-quinic or (-)-shikimic acids.\nThe Gilead-Roche \"first generation\" analogue with the double bond oriented toward the hydroxy-group 33 proved more active than its counterpart 34 (Figure 9, Scheme 9) [26, 27]. Further modification of the structure 33 was based on X-ray analysis of protein - inhibitor complexes and led to Tamiflu\u00ae (Scheme 10).\nPrime synthesis of Tamiflu\u00ae from (-)-shikimic acid involved several steps (Schemes 5, 6, 10). Since this starting material is rather expensive more economic approaches have been studied. The technological approach to the key epoxide 75 from (-)-quinic acid (Scheme 12) involves bicyclic lactone 70 controlled dehydration to form 73 and regiospecific acetal reduction using borane-dimethylsulfide complex in the presence of a&nbsp;silylating agent [31]. Use of the developed methods and shikimic acid as the starting material allowed for an efficient access to the target epoxide 75 (Scheme 13).\nThe epoxide 75 has been transformed into the final product in several steps (Scheme 14).\nMost advanced synthetic routes transforming 75 into Tamiflu\u00ae rely upon the use of tert-butylamine and then diallylamine [11, 33] (Scheme 15).\nCurrent studies on transformation of glucose into shikimic acid by genetically modified strain of Escherichia coli (Scheme 16) are likely to secure supplies of this convenient starting material for Tamiflu\u00ae production [37].\nE.J. Corey et al. [40] have developed enantioselective total synthesis of Tamiflu\u00ae. [2+4] cycloaddition reaction of butadiene and trifluoroethylacrylate in the presence of a&nbsp;chiral oxazoborolidine catalyst provided cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid derivative (87, Scheme 19). Transformation of 87 into 99 embraced several steps, including the novel haloamidation [41] (86 into 97). The synthesis route involved 12 steps and afforded Tamiflu\u00ae in 25% overall yield.\nCatalytic enantioselective reaction of the easily accessible meso-aziridine 101 (Scheme 21) with trimethylsilylazide provided the cornerstone to total synthesis of Tamiflu\u00ae by M. Shibasaki et al. [48]. The synthetic route from azide 102 to the target involved several steps (Schemes 23 and 24). Among them the efficient allylic oxidation of 109 and the nickel-catalyzed conjugate addition of trimethylsilylcyanide to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone 110 that contribute to general synthetic methodology.\nIn the synthesis developed by Cong i&nbsp;Yao [51], the starting material - serine-derived aldehyde 117 (Garner's aldehyde, Scheme 25) has been selected from the \"chiral pool\". The synthesis involves a&nbsp;sequence of diastereoselective reactions (Schemes 25, 26 and 27) and the ring-closure metathesis reaction (130 into 131) using the II generation Grubbs catalyst\n. Approaches to Tamiflu\u00ae illustrate the impressive achievements of organic synthesis. However, at present the high cost of this drug may hamper its broader application.

            "abstract": "Cisplatin is an important anticancer drug. Unfortunately it does not bring satisfactory effects in all types of tumor. Other problems are its toxicity and intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumor cells. That is why new drugs based on this molecule are being searched. One of the promising group of chemical compounds are neutral platinum(IV) complexes. They are more inert than platinum(II) complexes. In consequence their reactivity in bloodstream is weaker and more molecules can reach their target.\nMany studies were done to establish the relation among the structure, lipophilicity, reduction potential and cytotoxicity of those complexes.\nIt is believed that platinum(IV) complexes must be reduced to platinum(II) complexes to obtain cytotoxicity. The speed of reduction depends on the nature of axial ligands. The complexes with chloride ligands are reduced the most quickly and complexes with hydroxide ligands are reduced the most slowly. In vitro cytotoxic activity of those complexes was shown to depend on their reduction potential. However suggestions exist that this result can be misleading for their in vivo activity, as platinum(IV) complexes are pro-drugs and might be inactive before reaching cancer cells.\nIn a&nbsp;study of group of platinum(IV) complexes, derivatives of cisplatin and dichloroethylenediamineplatinum(II), a&nbsp;tendency for an increase of cytotoxic activity when lipophilicity increased was observed. However in a&nbsp;study of tetrakis(carboxylato)(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(IV) complexes, different cytotoxic activity of complexes possessing similar lipophilicity was observed. Hence lipophilicity of complex is important but it is not the only factor that determines complex activity.\nIn other studies complexes of general structure cis, trans, cis-[PtNH3(RNH2)Cl2(OCOR')2] were examined. The research showed an increased activity of compounds with longer carbon chains of carboxylate axial ligands. It was also revealed that complexes with alicyclic amine ligands were more cytotoxic than those with aliphatic or aromatic amine ligands.\nHall et al. revealed that platinum(IV) complexes, derivatives of cisplatin and dichloroethylenediamineplatinum(II), are active against DLD-1 colon cancer cell line in hypoxic environment. An examination of trans-dichlorodihydroxo(dimethylamine)(isopropylamine)platinum(IV) revealed its greater cytotoxic activity against A2780, CH1 and 41M human ovarian cancer cell lines, in vitro. Moreover this complex was shown to be active against A2780cisR, CH1cisR and 41McisR human ovarian cell lines which are resistant to cisplatin. Two platinum(IV) complexes: iproplatin (cis, trans, cis-dichlorodihydroxobis(isopropylamine)platinum(IV)) and tetraplatin (tetrachloro(cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)platinum(IV)) have had entered clinical trials. However iproplatin occurred to be less active than cisplatin and tetraplatin turned out to be neurotoxic. Presently two other complexes seem to be very promising: satraplatin (bis(acetato)amminedichlorocyclohexylamineplatinum(IV)) and adamplatin (bis(acetato)(1-adamantylamine)amminedichloroplatinum(IV)). Both have entered clinical trials.\nThere are some \"nonstandard\" approaches to investigating platinum complexes. For example platinum(IV) complexes with radioactive iodine isotope or with enzyme inhibitor were examined.\nStudies mentioned above present different approaches to searching for anticancer drugs among platinum(IV) complexes. Despite all encountered difficulties during researching platinum(IV) complexes, this group of compounds still seems to be potential source of new anticancer drugs.

            "abstract": "Despite an enormous progress in the development of biophysical methods to establish protein structure and function, there is still a&nbsp;lack of precise ways of detection and mapping the specific fragments of molecules, in terms of their structure and properties. This is due to the fact that only a&nbsp;few amino acids show specific properties - like fluorescence of tryptophan - which enable analysis of the interaction and formation mechanism of protein - nucleic acids complexes. These problems one can easily overcome using proteins containing non-natural amino acid. However, all methods used in in vitro protein synthesis require up till now aminoacyl-tRNA as a&nbsp;substrate. Hence, the acylation of tRNA is a&nbsp;key and limiting step of every method. In the present article, we show all known non-enzymatical methods of tRNA acylation. One of them is based on ribozymes obtained by in vitro evolution (SELEX). These ribozymes that transfer amino acid bound to its 5'-end to 3'-end of tRNA can specifically recognize amino acid or tRNA. Other attempts aimed at chemical synthesis of aminoacyl-nucleotides, which were further ligated to appropriately prepared tRNA. As an amino acid donor, the peptidylnucleic acid (PNA) was used as well. An alternative method is an acylation under high hydrostatic pressure which allows to attach any amino acid to tRNA in a&nbsp;one-step procedure. All mentioned methods can be used in protein translation in vitro. For in vivo synthesis of protein containing non-natural amino acid, orthogonal pairs of tRNA-AARS are used. In orthogonal pairs mutated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase recognizes specific amino acid and acylates suppressor amber tRNA. Keywords: protein synthesis, tRNA aminoacylation, non-protein amino acids",

The carbohydrate portions of the glycoproteins as well as those of glycolipids obviously play key roles in biological recognition processes.\nA glycoprotein is a&nbsp;compound containing carbohydrate (or glycan) covalently linked to protein. The carbohydrate may be in a&nbsp;form of monosaccharide, disaccharide(s), oligosaccharide(s), polysaccharide(s), or their derivatives (e.g. sulfo- or phos-pho-substituted). One, a&nbsp;few, or many carbohydrate units may be present.\nThere are two most common types of glycoproteins: O- and N-glycoproteins. In eukaryotes, the most prevalent type of O-linked glycosylation is the mucin-type glycosylation, where N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) is linked in an \u03b1-anomeric configuration to the \u03b2-hydroxyl group of either a&nbsp;serine or a&nbsp;threonine residue of the polypeptide. Other types of O-linked glycosylation include glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin and chondrotin sulfate, which are attached to the polypeptide chain through \u03b2-linked xylose residues.\nAn older and more prevalent type of glycosylation, N-linked glycosylation, is found in a&nbsp;wide range of organisms ranging from Archae to mammals and other eukaryotes. N-Glycosylation is a&nbsp;modification performed cotranslationally (during the translation of mRNA to protein) and is available to any secreted or membrane-bound protein containing the triplet amino acid sequence AsnXxxSer/Thr (where Xxx is any amino acid except Pro). An oligosaccharide is transferred to the amide side chain of Asn from a&nbsp;dolichol phosphate glycosyl donor, by the action of mem-brane-bound oligosaccharyl transferase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The fully translated glycoprotein is then subject to glycan trimming and processing which is further elaborated in the ER and Golgi apparatus. Keywords: N- i&nbsp;O- glycoproteins",

This article reviews the current state of studies of this seemingly simple system, focusing particularly on the most popular techniques applied: computational chemistry, vibrational spectroscopy and diffraction methods.\nThe picture of proton transfer via the Grotthuss mechanism (Fig. 1) [8], has lately been critically examined basing on up-to-date experimental and computational data [7], but it is still found relevant in biological systems, e.g. in proton-transferring proteins [4].\nThe lengthy and heated debate on the identity of hydrated proton in an aqueous solution [6, 11, 12] has focused for many years on two isomeric structures (Fig. 2), the so-called \"Eigen cation\" [10] and \"Zundel cation\" [11]. The findings of the last decade have proved that these two forms coexist in a&nbsp;dynamic equilibrium [5, 13-25], and that the answer to this problem may as well be in the middle [26-28]. The most recent reports from the last few years are reviewed here in considerable detail.

The necessary condition of the correct interpretation of the complex properties of the compounds studied in electronic excited states is the proper choice of solvents of specific properties. Through this proper choice of solvents it becomes possible to study the role of nonspecific and specific (hydrogen bonds) interactions with the solvent and to observe the intramolecular and intermolecular processes of deactivation. The results presented could be obtained thanks to the use of the steady-state and time-resolved laser methods of absorption and emission spectroscopy with a&nbsp;pico- and femtosecond resolution.\nThe results obtained can be helpful in the study of compounds of similar properties and more complex systems including biological systems.

The most populated gramicidin a&nbsp;(VgA) has a&nbsp;sequence CH(O)-Val1-Gly-Ala-D-Leu-Ala-D-Val-Val-D-Val-Trp-D-Leu-Trp11-D-Leu-Trp-D-Leu-Trp-NHCH2CH2OH.\nGramicidin was isolated in 1939 and its sequence was determined five years later. First models of its secondary structure based on helical conformation were proposed in 1971-1974 explaining channel-like properties of the peptide.\nDespite over 60 years of studies on gramicidin, there are still numerous unans-wered questions concerning its structure and functioning. Even fundamental issues of dimers type and handedness of helices in the gramicidin channel formed by the peptide in the bacterial cell membranes are not univocally accepted.\nAfter refining several crystal structures of gramicidin D complexes with alkali metal salts, we have at hands not only more facts concerning double-stranded antiparallel gramicidin dimers, but also new puzzled observations due to very high reso-lution data collected. These, among others, include visible asymmetry of cations' sites and occupations in the gramicidin channels, as well as specific arrangement of heterodimers in the crystals.\nThe paper describes these interesting features of the complexed gramicidin structure and proposes some new explanations.

They are prepared in three basic forms: (i) as thin multilayered foils consisting of alternating layers of oxidizer and fuel, (ii) mixtures of fuel and oxidizer nanoparticles, and (iii) mixtures obtai-ned via sol-gel synthesis. Thin foils are nanoscaled only in one dimension. in such composites, there are large, regular planar interfaces between fuel and oxidizer layers which thickness is below 100 nm. The composites are characterized by a&nbsp;very close physical contact of reactants and a&nbsp;lack of impurities between them as they are usually obtained by vacuum deposition of the components. The second kind of nanoems are mixtures prepared by powder mixing of nanometer sized particles of oxidizer and fuel. components are previously produced via chemical or physical processing and then mixed in an appropriate solvent. being consisted of the same components as conventional thermites (metal powders - usually al, and metal oxides - usually Fe2O3), this nanocomposites are known as \"superthermites\". In contrast to the conventional thermites, supertermites are very sensitive to ignition and they may burn at a&nbsp;velocity of 1 km/s or even more. Synthesis of nanoems using sol-gel chemistry is a&nbsp;solution phase synthetic route. Its benefits include the convenience of low-temperature preparation using general and inexpensive laboratory equipment. The nanoparticles of both oxidizer and fuel precipitate from a&nbsp;colloidal solution (sol). This means that nanocomposites are formed by simultaneous condensation and/or crystallization of dissolved molecular precursors, i.e. by growth of particles and not by their size reduction. The obtained gels (organic and/or inorganic substances) are dried either by controlled evaporation of solvent, by freeze-drying or by supercritical extraction. The size of the particles (homogeneity of the composition) can be varied by changing synthesis and drying conditions. keywords: energetic materials, nanostructures, sol-gel synthesis.",

            "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that produce a&nbsp;wide range of secondary metabolites. Part of them is toxic or shows bioactivity in other organisms, including mammals [1-2]. The main classes of cyanobacterial toxins comprise of hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatotoxins and lipopolysaccharides [1]. Hepatotoxins, microcystins and nodularins are the most common cyanotoxins. Microcystins, the cyclic heptapeptides [3] are produced by freshwater cyanobacteria of the genera Microcystis, Anabaena, Planktothrix (Oscillatoria), Nostoc, Hapalosiphon and Anabaenopsis. Nodularin (NOD-R) the cyclic pentapeptide hepatotoxin [4] is produced by brackish water cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. Microcystins and nodularins are extremely toxic due to their action on type 1 and 2A protein phosphatase enzymes that play a&nbsp;key role in the control of cellular meta-bolism [5]. The main groups of neurotoxins produced by cyanobacteria include anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a(s), saxitoxins [1] and the recently identified \u03b2-N-methylamino--L-alanine (BMAA) [6]. The latter has been reported to biomagnify within the Guam ecosystem and was suggested to be a&nbsp;possible cause of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) [6].\nIn the Baltic Sea N. spumigena is the main toxic and bloom-forming cyanobacterial species [7]. Nodularin concentration can temporarily reach over 20 mg dm-3 [7]. The toxin accumulates in different elements of the Baltic ecosystem, including sediments, mussels and fish [8-9]. Apart from NOD-R, minor amounts of other NOD analogues have been characterized in N. spumigena cells [4, 10]: geometrical isomers, linear forms, three demethylated analogues and three analogues with additional methyl group. Nodularin is characterized by high stability. The loss of the toxin in water is mainly due to degradation by the naturally occurring bacterial community [11]. However, the UV radiation as well as sorption on sediments and sus-pended particles has also some impact on nodularin concentration. In organisms microcystins are detoxified by conjugation with activated glutathione, however, the pathway of nodularin biotransformation has not been revealed yet.

It is sometimes said that our eyes are an interface between our brain and the outside world. a&nbsp;good example of putting this assumption into practice can be found in the educational packages backing up chemistry curricula at different educational levels. The multimedia software designed or code signed by the author of the article comprises either succinct printed textbooks with integral CDs, or multimedia textbooks available both on CDs and on the Internet.\nEach of the CD multimedia lessons contains animations and simulations of chemical processes and phenomena, dynamic and three-dimensional element and compound models, tests and problem solving tasks, as well as film sequences illus-trating chemical experiments. Not only do those films allow the user to watch respective fragments of a&nbsp;given experiment in close-up so as to analyze interrelationships between them, but they can also be played repeatedly, thus making the user memorize the sequence of laboratory activities or the course of industrial processes. Such presentations of experiments can help teachers and students who are, for some reasons, unable to carry them out on their own. They are also an inspiration for those willing to carry out new experiments and, above all, an aid to those looking for didactic means to explain complex questions. What is important is that all experiments presented on the CDs are only those that can be always carried out safely, successfully and economically. Their visualizations create images of the course of chemical experiments in the learner's mind, which, though no substitute for their actual replication, can still be a&nbsp;valuable source of knowledge.\nThe article additionally presents the interactive board as means of creating and saving interactive educational images, a&nbsp;tool of interactive evaluation of knowledge and skills, a&nbsp;field for playing educational games, a&nbsp;device helping the teacher organize his work, a&nbsp;medium of remote teaching, and a&nbsp;his inspiration for carrying out and interpreting experiments.

            "abstract": "Nucleotides, being multifunctional ligands with donor nitrogen and oxygen atoms, take part in the majority of selective and specific processes occurring in nature [1-15]. It has been established that nucleotides react with the polyamines (biogenic amines) present in the living organisms and take part in genetic information transfer [16-24]. Nucleotides are composed of a&nbsp;purine or pyrimidine base, sugar residua and phosphate groups (Fig. 1) [25-27]. Each of the three components have potential centres of interaction with metal ions [28-29]. Because of the wide diversity of coordination possibilities there are often controversies as to the mode of coordination even in simple complexes with metal ions. Some authors claim that only nitrogen atoms of the nucleotide are effectively engaged in the metallation [30-43], while others maintain that it requires a&nbsp;combined engagement of nitrogen atoms and phosphate group [44-71]. There are also researchers who point to the involvement of only phosphate group of the nucleotide in the metallation [72-77].\nThe reaction of nucleotides with tetramines results in the formation of molecular complexes (Fig. 3) [78-88]. In the literature to date, there is no agreement as to the character of interactions and effectiveness of nucleotide donor groups in the formation of adducts with polyamines [80-82, 85-87, 89, 90]. According to some authors, the interaction between a&nbsp;nucleotide and polyamines in the metal-free systems has a&nbsp;noncovalent ion-ion or ion-dipole nature and the stability of molecular complexes is determined by the number of active centres in the reagents and the structural factor [80-84, 87]. According to other authors, it is a&nbsp;typical electrostatic interaction and the adduct stability is determined by the charge of the reagents [85, 89]. In the adducts formed by nucleotides with polyamines, the main interaction centres of a&nbsp;nucleotide are endocyclic nitrogen atoms and a&nbsp;phosphate group (the latter undergoes deprotonation already at a&nbsp;low pH), while in the case of tetramine the interaction centres are the NHx+ groups [77, 80-87, 89-91].\nIn the ternary systems of metal/nucleotide/tetramine, the following heteroligand molecular complexes are formed: ML\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7HxL' (x = 4, HxL'-fully protonated polyamine) (Fig. 4) [80-82, 91, 94, 96], mixed protonated complexes MLHxL' (x = 1, 2, 3) (Fig. 5) [81, 82, 92, 96] and MLL' type complexes (Fig. 6) [81, 82, 91]. a&nbsp;significant influence of polyamines on the character of interactions of nucleotides with metal ions has been noted [80-82, 90-96]. In molecular complexes, the fully protonated polyamine is located in the outer coordination sphere. In the MLHxL' type complexes, the deprotonated nitrogen atoms of tetramine are involved in the coordination, while its protonated centres -NHx+ take part in noncovalent interactions that additionally stabilise the complex [81, 82, 92, 96, 97]. In the MLL' type complexes, oxygen atoms of nucleotide phosphate group and deprotonated nitrogen atoms of tetramine are in the inner coordination sphere, while nucleotide donor nitrogen atoms do not take part in the metallation [81, 82, 91].

            "abstract": "In this paper are summarized the results concerning studies on fundamental electrochemical properties of binary and ternary noble metal alloys in acidic solution. The systems were characterized electrochemically using cyclic voltammetry technique (CV). a&nbsp;CV curve can be treated as a&nbsp;basic mean of in situ surface analysis of electrodes of this type. The voltammogram recorded under given experimental conditions is characteristic of the individual noble metal or alloy and it is an electrochemical 'fingerprint' of the investigated sample. Qualitative and quanti-tative conclusions can be drawn about the surface state of noble metal alloys on the basis of the course of CV curves by the use of the distinctive features associated with each component. Such an analysis is possible due to the fact that the voltammograms for pure metals differ markedly from each other in respect of the region of surface oxide formation and its reduction as well as the appearance of the region where hydrogen electrosorption takes place. In particular, the potential of the oxygen desorption peak is a&nbsp;linear function of the alloy surface composition. The influence of the procedure of prolonged potential cycling on electrochemical behavior of the alloys is presented. During the electrochemical treatment the alloy surface becomes enriched with components that are more resistant to electrochemical dissolution, occurring at sufficiently high potentials. The course of the voltammogram undergoes dramatic changes concerning the signals originating from hydrogen and oxygen electrosorption. As a&nbsp;result of the procedure of potential cycling both alloy surface and bulk can become heterogeneous. Selective removal of alloy components during the electrochemical treatment allows for in situ preparation of alloy electrodes possessing a&nbsp;variety of electrocatalytic properties. Keywords: noble metals and their alloys, hydrogen and oxygen electrosorption, electrochemical treatment, cyclic voltammetry.",

            "abstract": "The increasing concentrations of platinum and palladium in the environment have been observed in the last quarter of the last century. The review summarizes current knowledge concerning the emission of platinum and palladium into biosphere, environmental mobility of these metals, their speciation and bioavailability for living organisms.\nThe main sources of emission of these metals are chemical, petroleum and electronic industries, car catalytic converters, hospitals and jewellery [8, 9, 31]. Platinum, palladium and rhodium are released from automobile catalysts during vehicle operation in the form of nanometer size particles, mainly in metallic form [19]. These fine particles [21, 23] are mostly deposited close to the communication routes (in a&nbsp;road dust and soil) [31, 33, 34], but the last evidence showed that due to atmospheric dispersion they could be also transferred for longer distances, even to glaciers and snows of central Greenland [29, 35, 51]. The storm water transports particles containing Pt and Pd into road drainage basins, sludge and aquatic environment (urban lakes and rivers and their sediments) [43, 44, 49]. The increased concentrations of precious metals were found in different environmental samples such as atmospheric aerosols and particulate matter, road and tunnel dust, soil, lake and river sediments, snow and vegetation growing in the roadside environment. The total deposition of these elements in the northern hemisphere was assessed as 20-50 ton/year of Pd and 9-20 ton/year of Pt [35].\nPlatinum and palladium are chemically inert, but under atmospheric conditions (rainwater of low pH, high content of chlorides) and operation of natural complexing agents can be partially oxidized and transformed in soil and sediments into soluble species [47-53, 66]. In such form they became available for plants growing on contaminated soil or can be taken up by aquatic animals such as isopods, mussels, fish, and parasites [69-75, 87-90, 93, 97]. The experimental data shows that palladium is the most mobile and bioavailable element among other platinum group metals (Pd > Rh ? Pt). The bioaccumulation factors of palladium for plants and aqueous animals are similar to that calculated for copper and a&nbsp;magnitude higher than occurring for lead [73, 89] [Tables 1 and 2]. The plant and animal cells in the presence of high concentration of palladium induce production of sulfur-rich detoxification compounds, such as phytochelatines for plants [72, 81] and metallothioneins for animals [48, 98]. The internal organs of birds living in natural habitat also contain elevated concentrations of noble metals [100, 101]. The higher concentration of palladium (and rhodium) than platinum were found in urine of unexposed individuals [105, 106, Table 3], what suggests a&nbsp;different environmental mobility and metabolism of Pd and Rh. The Pd level in human urine, but not Pt, was correlated with traffic intensity [106].\nRecent investigations confirmed that platinum and palladium of anthropogenic origin are accumulated in environment and they have high biological availability for plants, animals and humans.

            "abstract": "Several nucleoside analogues have found successful application as antiviral and anticancer agents. Their mode of action differs, but in the most general terms they have been developed as inhibitors or competitors of natural 2'-deoxynucleosides in the process of their conversion to the corresponding nucleoside-5'-triphosphates. As such, they can be incorporated into a&nbsp;growing viral DNA strand by a&nbsp;DNA polymerase resulting in chain termination. In cancer therapy, modified nucleosides, after being phosphorylated to the corresponding monophosphates, block DNA biosynthesis by deactivating nucleoside syntheses. Hence biological activity of nucleoside analogues in most cases depends on the intracellular phosphorylation by viral and/or cellular kinases to their respective mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives. Among the three successive activating phosphorylation steps the first one has fundamental importance as the rate-limiting step. Several different enzymes can perform this initial phosphorylation, depending on the nature of the aglycone. Also, the presence and activity of the intracellular enzymes necessary for the activation of nucleoside analogues are highly dependent on the host species, the cell type, and the stage in the cell cycle. Moreover, in many cases, nucleoside analogues are poor substrates for the cellular kinases needed for their activation. For all these reasons, intracellular nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) delivery has been considered for overcoming the first phosphorylation step.\nUnfortunately, NMPs themselves cannot be used as potential chemotherapeutic agents. Owing to their high polarity, these compounds are not able to penetrate cellular membrane or the blood-brain barrier easily. Therefore, in order to reduce the phosphate negative charge and enable the modified nucleotide to enter the cell, many nucleotides modified on the phos-phate moiety by so-called masking group have been synthesized.\nA suitable nucleotide prodrug (so-called pronucleotide) has to fulfill two requirements: i) it has to be lipophilic enough for passive diffusion of the membrane and the blood-brain barrier; ii) it should be able to deliver the nucleoside by chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis leaving a&nbsp;non-toxic masking group.\nMany strategies using various protecting groups for the phosphate moiety have been deve-loped to achieve this goal. The majority of strategies for unmasking pronucleotides that have been examined to date have involved substrate-nonspecific enzymes to remove one or more groups that are attached to the 5'MP moiety. Carboxylesterases (CEs) have attracted considerable attention, since they include bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) [(bis(POM)] and S-acyl-2-thioethyl (SATE) moieties which are initially unmasked by CE-mediated cleavage. a&nbsp;combination of aryl ester and amino acid phosphoramidate groups as a&nbsp;particular class of enzyme-labile protecting groups was developed for the delivery of antiviral nucleoside prodrugs. An endogenous phosphoramidase was responsible and necessary for the biological activity of those compounds in living cells.\nOn the other side almost all approaches based on chemical hydrolysis reported so far were unable to deliver the nucleotide selectively exept the cycloSal approach.\nThis review will predominantly concentrate on the different approaches to the design of nucleotide prodrugs.

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring enediyne anticancer antibiotics derived from bacterial sources are reviewed. The enediynes represent promising chemotherapeutic agents that exhibit unprecedented molecular architecture, fascinating modes of action and extremely potent anticancer activity, more potent than other anticancer drugs. The enediynes are structurally characterized by an unsaturated core with two acetylenic groups conjugated with a&nbsp;double bond. All these molecules contain three impor-tant functional domains: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\tan enediyne ring (nine-membered or ten-membered) as a&nbsp;highly reactive core that generates the reactive diradicals, thus providing the fragments that damage DNA, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\ta triggering device which after suitable activation under physiological conditions initiates the cascade of reactions that leads to the generation of diradicals, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-\ta delivery system that is responsible for targeting DNA.\nThe mode of action of the enediyne antibiotics is the ability to produce single--stranded or double-stranded DNA lesions by a&nbsp;mechanism which involves the inter-actions with duplex DNA along specific sequences within the minor groove. This is followed by the formation of a&nbsp;highly reactive benzenoid diradical via Bergman or Myers-Saito cyloaromatization and abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the deoxyribose of DNA leading to site-specific DNA breaks, which induces cell apoptosis.\nThe diradical (p-benzyne) intermediates in simple prototype enediynes were postulated by Bergman in 1972 and provided the basis for the mechanism of action of the naturally occurring enediynes.\nOver 20 natural enediynes antibiotics are known now. They are divided into two distinct groups; those containing a&nbsp;nine membered enediynes chromophore non-covalently associated with a&nbsp;stabilizing apoprotein (neocarzinostatin 1, kedarcidin 2, lidamycin 3, maduropeptin 4, N1999A2 5) and those containing ten membered enediyne ring (calicheamicins 6, dynemicins 7, esperamicin 8, namenamicin 9, shishijimicins 10). However, the lack of selectivity for cancer cells and toxicity of natural enediynes have complicated their use in cancer chemotherapy. Several mono-clonal antibody-enediynes and polymer-enediynes conjugates have been prepared and evaluated for clinical significance as anticancer drugs. Much effort has been devoted to the design and synthesis of new, simplified, fully synthetic analogues characterized by similar mode of action.

            "abstract": "Radiation chemistry is a&nbsp;part of the physical chemistry similary like photo-chemistry, plasma-chemistry, ultrasonic-chemistry etc. Ionizing radiation produces abundant secondary electrons (Fig. 1). Following these primary events, the ions, secondary electrons and excited molecules undergo further transformations, exchanging charges and energy and reacting with surrounding molecules, thereby producing free radicals and other reactive species which finally evolve into new stable products. Three main sources of radiation are applied for radiation processing [2]. These are electron accelerators [12], gamma sources [11] and X-ray unit based on e-/X conversion process [14].\nRadiation processing was used early on for polymer modification [15, 16]. The intermediates formed during material irradiation can follow several reaction paths that result in disproportion, hydrogen abstraction, arrangements and/or the formation of new bonds. Nowadays, the modification of polymers [1] covers radiation cross-linking (Fig. 2), radiation-induced polymerization (graft polymerization and curing) (Fig. 4) and the degradation of polymers (Fig. 3) [32]. Some polymers predominantly undergo crosslinking other degradation (Tab. 1). However new techniques allow crosslinking of polymers which were considered to be degradable only, like PTFE [18] and cellulose derivatives [25]. Regarding natural polymers the biggest application concerns rubber pre-crosslinking in tire industry [23]. The processing of natural polymers is also being developed to elaborate new biodegradable materials [25]. The radiation crosslinked wires and cables show excellent heat resistance (long-term thermal stability and short-term thermal stability) as well as abrasion resistance [26, 33-35]. Other big application is crosslinking of XLPE type pipes which are widely used for hot water and floor heating [30]. Polybutelene terephtalate (PBT), which is a&nbsp;plastic for electronic industry, can be crosslinked by radiation and lead free soldering materials can be applied in such a&nbsp;case [31]. This method of crosslinking is also applied to manufacture thermoshrinkable tubes and types possessing \"memory effect\" [36, 37]. Through radiation, grafting metal adsorbents and ion exchange membranes can be developed (Fig. 5) [20].\nRadiation is early applied tool in the area of nanomaterials engineering; arrangement of atoms and ions has been performed using ion or electron beams for many years [46]. New trends concern surface curing and development of ion track membranes and controlled release drug-delivery systems [48]. Finally, radiation processing concerns gem stones colorization, development of high temperature resistant fibers (SiC) and semiconductor modification [44].\nOver the past few years, radiation processing technologies aimed at ensuring the safety of gaseous and liquid effluents discharged to the environment have been developed. It has been demonstrated that radiation processing based technologies for flue gas treatment (SOX and NOX removal), wastewater purification, and sludge hygienization can be effectively deployed to mitigate environmental degradation [51, 52]. Electron beam technology is among the most promising advanced technologies of new generation. This is a&nbsp;dry-scrubbing process of simultaneous SO2 and NOx removal, where no waste except the fertilizer by-product are generated [53, 54].The other possibility is application of the process for VOC removal. Tests at the pilot plant constructed at a&nbsp;coal-fired power station were performed with the purpose of estimating the influence of electron beam on VOCs present in flue gas, during SO2 and NOx removal [59, 60]. The removal efficiencies have been ranged from 40% up to 98%. The chlorocarbons including dioxins may be removed with high efficiency as well [57, 58]. During the radiolysis of water reactive radicals of strong oxidizing or reducing properties are formed that can transform the pollutants in the liquids wastes (Fig. 10, 11) [61, 62]. a&nbsp;large number of substances such as hard surfactants, lignin, pesticides cannot be degraded by conventional biochemical methods and thus escape from decomposition in biological treatment. Research and industrial (Fig. 13) treatments testify significant improvement of pollutant biodegradability after radiation-oxidation in aerated wastewater [66].

Copper ions and complexes can induce formation of reactive oxygen species, that can damage biomolecules including unsaturated lipids and DNA. In the past few years exciting advances have been made toward understanding how copper is transported within cells. Dysfunction of copper metabolism can lead to its excess or defi-ciency.

Another type of interaction was found for CH group of carborane - participating in hydrogen-bonded complexes, although these complexes are approximately 21 kJ/mol less stable than complexes formed by BH groups [2-8]. Proton - hydride bonds are formed mainly due to electrostatic interactions between boron--bound hydrogen atom bearing partial negative charge and hydrogen atom of a&nbsp;biomolecule bearing partial positive charge. It was found that carboranes forms proton - hydride bonds with biomolecules preferably with BH groups of the cage opposite to the carbon atom [8].\nCarboranes have been used as hydrophobic pharmacophores in design of analogues of biologically active compounds such as estradiol, retinoic acids, protein kinase C modulators and TNF-? activity modulators [9-14].

The lectures in polish had continued in Krakow during the whole XIX c. In Wilno the university was closed by Russian authorities in 1832 after the Polish anti-Russian uprising. The same year the Russian authorities had closed the polish Univer-sity in Warszawa opened in 1816. The other polish University that was active in Warszawa in 1862-1869 was replaced by the Imperial (Russian) Warsaw University that became polish in 1915. At the Lw\u00f3w German University and the Lw\u00f3w German Technical Academy (from 1872 Technical University) the lectures of chemistry were given in polish from 1872. After regaining of independence by Poland in 1918 the Wilno University was renewed and a&nbsp;new University in Pozna\u0144 was organised. The activity of the chemistry chairs at these universities are discussed in the article. Keywords: teaching, chemistry, Poland, years 1783-1939.",

The conservation rules can be formulated for the elements, electrons and protons.\nAmong others, the generalised electron balance (GEB) concept presented and applied in some author's papers [1-7, 14-16] is derived from the elementary rules of conservation and exemplified by some batch and dynamic (titration) systems of a&nbsp;different degree of complexity.\nSome elementary rules of conservation are interdependent. This interdependency of the resulting balances and formulation of the set of independent relationships will be considered with the help of some examples, where the complex nature of the system, exemplified by the formation of aqua-complexes by both ionic and neutral species, will also be taken into account. Among others, the dynamic system is exemplified by titration of KIO3 + HCl + H2SeO3 + HgCl2 with ascorbic acid (C6H8O6). The degree of complexity of this system is evidenced by more than 40 equilibrium constants involved in the related balances.

The above processes are important in developing rechargeable magnesium batteries but can also help organic chemists for deeper understanding of the formation of Grignard reagents in classic reactions.\nMagnesium deposition from solutions of Grignard reagents has been known for more than 80 years but repeated efforts to explain the reason of reversibility and find other suitable electrolytes were unsuccessful for a&nbsp;long time. Recently, a&nbsp;sig-nificant progress was achieved due to the application of modern spectroscopic methods combined with electrochemical measurements. These results are presented. They include a&nbsp;finding of Liebenow [27, 28] that the magnesium dissolution strongly depends on the morphology of depositions and conclusions from reports of Aurbach and coworkers [12, 32-42] which explained in detail characteristics of the magnesium surface in a&nbsp;contact with different electrolytes, the role of adsorption of ions and radicals in electrode processes and the nature of electro-active species in various solutions.

            "abstract": "This paper reviews wetting phenomena in relation to different types of solids and human skin in the presence of surfactants. Wettability of solids by surfactants is important for many technological applications. The addition of surfactants is necessary to achieve a&nbsp;better wettability of a&nbsp;given solid.\nIn the first part of this article the definition of a&nbsp;contact angle and an interfacial tension along with methods of their determination is presented. Next, a&nbsp;relationship between a&nbsp;liquid--air, a&nbsp;solid-air and a&nbsp;solid-liquid interfacial tensions and wettability of solids is shown.\nThree types of wetting are discussed in this work: a&nbsp;spreading wetting, an adhesional wetting, and an immersional wetting. Wettability forces of hard surface and powders are also described in this part of the article.\nIn the third part of the article main aspects related to the solids critical surface tension of wetting are presented. Different problems of solids' wetting critical surface tension are described, since there is still no unambiguous method to determine this value.\nLater, based on the Lucassen-Reynolds equation we described the dependence between the adsorption of surfactants at the interfaces, mainly in a&nbsp;solid-water-air systems and wetting of solids, because they are both strongly related. From this equation the slope of a&nbsp;plot of \u03b3LVcos\u03b8 (adhesion tension) versus \u03b3LV (surface tension) gives us the information about the surface concentration of the surfactant at water-air and a&nbsp;solid-water interfaces in a&nbsp;solid--water-air system including both non-polar (low-energy) and polar (high-energy) solids. We have also shown that in the case of hydrophobic solids, for several types of surfactants, there is a&nbsp;constant negative slope of \u03b3LV cos\u03b8-\u03b3LV curve. However, for high-energy polar solids the positive slope of this curve is observed and there is no linear dependence between adhesional and surface tension. Thus, for a&nbsp;high energy solid-aqueous surfactant solution-air systems it is difficult to establish synonymous mutual relationships between the adsorption of surfactant at a&nbsp;solid-air, a&nbsp;solid-liquid and a&nbsp;liquid-air interfaces and wettability of high-energy hydrophilic solids.\nAt the end we presented main problems dealing with wettability of human skin surface, which is the most important factor of the skin protective function. It minimizes water loose, prevents entry of a&nbsp;foreign matter and chemicals, and defines smoothness and elasticity of the skin. Surprisingly, this subject has received a&nbsp;little attention in the literature.\nThe human skin surface, after the extraction of sebum (skin surface lipids) belongs to hydrophobic surfaces (low-energy) in terms of critical surface tension and polar and dispersion components of a&nbsp;free surface energy. El-Shimi and Goddard compared the skin surface with polymer surfaces such as polyvinylchloride, polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene, but we have to remember that the human skin is a&nbsp;living matter and in the presence of sebum becomes hydrophilic. In order to remove this fatty film from the skin surface cleansing products, which contain many various surfactants, are used. Good wetting and cleansing effects of such products depend on surfactants ability to adsorb on the skin surface and reduce an interfacial tension at water-skin interface in skin-water-air system.

Number of patients with diagnosed cancer of this type increases annually by 10 to 15%. Skin cancer belongs to the group of malicious in situ cancers, which hardly develops metastasis to other organs. Nevertheless considering the frequency of occurrence and localization, its importance should not be disregarded. The most often occurring skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which stands for about 65-75% of all skin cancers and about 25% of all diagnosed cases of cancer. Second most encountered skin cancer is squa-mous cell carcinoma, which constitutes 20-30% of all skin cancers, while malicious melanoma only 1.5-2%. Oncological surgery and radiotherapy are the most popular treatments of skin cancer, while chemotherapy is less applied. Results of the first two methods are comparable. Differences refer to frequency of occurrence, side effects, treatment and cosmetic effects having influence on the quality of patients' life. Third type of skin cancer - malicious melanoma - belongs to the group of the most aggressive, which hardly undergo treatment. The cytostatic drug being most active in monotherapy of melanoma is decarbazine.

Furanocoumarins are one of the more important secondary metabolites of many plants. Many sorts of furanocoumarins are known. Psolaren and its derivatives belong to them.\nLinear furanocoumarins have been isolated from wild and garden plants (Umbelliferae, Apiacae, Leguminosae). The increase of psolarens content (even dozens as much) in plants may be caused both by pathogenic bacterium or virus infection and by insects attack. This effect is used to obtain these compounds.\nThe psolaren and its derivatives can also be prepared by the synthetic way. It is realized in the consequence of two-reaction pathway: (1) by the construction of the carbon framework from three condensed rings (starting from suitable derivatives of the resorcin) and (2) by the chemical modification of substituents. The combination of these methods allows us to synthesize the majority of naturally occurring psolarens and its derivatives characterized by considerable biological activity.\nPsolaren and its derivatives (linear furanocoumarins) are used in dermatology for treatment of skin diseases such as vitiligo and psoriasis. They have also been used as probes of nucleic acid structure and function.\nPsolaren demonstrates high activity towards UV. Its therapeutic activity and biocidality is caused by reactions that takes place in these conditions. Psolarens, in the presence of UV, interact with DNA inhibiting its replication.

The data concerning the adsorption of alkenes (ethene, propene, cis-but-2-ene, trans--but-2-ene), acetylene, benzene, acetone, and formaldehyde on Cu+ sites in zeolites CuX, CuY, and CuZSM-5 will be presented. The spectroscopic IR data, as well as the results of quantum chemical DFT calculations will be considered. Both IR studies and DFT calculations evidenced a&nbsp;weakening of C=C and C-C bonds. IR red shift reaches 78-115 cm-1 for C=C band and 168 cm-1 for acetylene. Moreover, in the case of ethene and acetylene the stretching modes of the C=C and C-C bonds which were IR inactive in free molecules became IR active when interacting with Cu+, indicating the loss of symmetry. On the contrary, the C=C stretching in trans-but-2-ene was still IR inactive when trans-but-2-ene interacted with Cu+. At high loading some Cu+ ions were able to bond two alkene molecules. Although the activation is small, it occurs also for aromatic C-C bond in benzene adsorbed on Cu+ site; the red band shift was 13 cm-1 i.e. much less than in the case of alkenes and acetylene. Similarly, the activation of C=O bond in acetone and formaldehyde inter-acting with Cu+ also results in the red band shift of 38 and 56 cm-1.\nAll the systems have been studied by DFT modeling which reveals the function of zeolite as a&nbsp;host for transition metal cationic centres which act as electron transmitters. Flow of electrons and subsequent activation is determined by the electronic structure of the molecules, their electron affinity and symmetry as well as the ability of a&nbsp;site to \u03c0-backdonation.

            "abstract": "The interest in the microwave assisted organic synthesis has been growing during the recent years. It results from an increasing knowledge of fundamentals of the dielectric heating theory, availability of an equipment designed especially for the laboratory use as well as the discovery of the special techniques of the micro-wave syntheses.\nThere are two different mechanisms of transformation of microwave energy into heat [6, 38-39]. The first one is the dipolar polarization. The electric field of electromagnetic irradiation causes such a&nbsp;change in the polar molecules orientation, that they align their dipole moments with the force field lines (Fig. 1). Another way of the microwave - molecule interaction that leads to heat evolution bases on the ionic conduction phenomenon. It originates from a&nbsp;presence of ionic species in the materials. Under the influence of the alternating dielectric field ions start to move through the solution, resulting in an increased collision rate, and the kinetic energy is converted into heat (Fig. 2).\nThe microwave activation in organic synthesis leads to considerable acceleration of a&nbsp;chemical reaction as compared to the traditional thermal process. It originates from the thermal effects, i.e. a&nbsp;change of the temperature profile during the process, the existence of so-called \"hot spots\" and the ability of solvent heating above its normal boiling point as well as the specific (no thermal) effects, connected with a&nbsp;change of the activation energy of the reaction and the activity of molecules [38].\nMoreover, microwave irradiation can also change direction, yield and selec-tivity of a&nbsp;chemical reaction. The extent of these changes depends on a&nbsp;solvent pola-rity and polarity of the ground and transition states of reagents (Fig. 3-5) [45].\nThe microwave syntheses are performed in multimode or single-mode cavities, with respect to the mode of the irradiation distribution over the working compartment [3, 4, 38]. The most popular techniques of microwave enhanced syntheses are as follow: syntheses in a&nbsp;solvent, solvent-free syntheses and supported syntheses. The application of one of them depends on the solvent and/or reagents properties as well as the reaction conditions [3, 38].

Explosives are a&nbsp;chemical energy source of high power (quantity of energy released in a&nbsp;time unit) and high density (quantity of energy per unit of volume). From the application point of view, explosives are divided into blasting, propelling and initiating ones. Of these, blasting explosives are the most common and their production worldwide reaches many millions of tons a&nbsp;year. Detonation is the basic form of their explosive transformation. It can be started by a&nbsp;relatively intense energetic stimulus, for example by a&nbsp;disruptive or other detonator. The linear velocity of propagation of explosive's chemical decomposition during detonation (detonation velocity) reaches several thousand meters per second. During detonation of a&nbsp;blasting explosive, the pressure of detonation products reaches the level of several GPa for mining explosives and as much as 50 GPa for the most powerful military explosives. The detonation pressure value is the measure of an explosive's brisance. It is the brisance that is used to destroy (crush) the structure of a&nbsp;medium.\nDue to the fast development of mining industry, the demand for effective, safe and inexpensive mining explosives was growing. In the mid-fifties of the 20th century new types of blasting explo-sives appeared on the US market without typical explosive material as part of the composition. The materials were a&nbsp;mixture of ammonium nitrate as oxidant (base ingredient) and an organic or inorganic combustible ingredient. Within a&nbsp;short time, ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO), a&nbsp;mixture of granulated ammonium nitrate and fuel oil characterized by a&nbsp;good flow handy in use, became the most widely used material. Nowadays, ANFO makes more than half of all explosives used in the mining industry worldwide. Simultaneously, another revolutionary innovation was introduced - substantial quantity of water, previously regarded as an ingredient that ruined the explosive properties of mixtures, was purposefully added to the explosive composition. The resulting slurry and emulsion explosives containing a&nbsp;saturated water solution of ammonium nitrate had a&nbsp;semi-liquid consistency, which made it possible to mechanise their manufacture and to load boreholes with explosives on the mining site.\nThe author has specified new, safe varieties of explosives which do not contain typical explosive compounds, with ammonium nitrate as a&nbsp;predominant ingredient. They are named \"third generation explosives\", the first generation being black gunpowder used for a&nbsp;millennium as the versatile explosive and the second generation being explosive chemical compounds (mostly nitrocompounds, aromatic nitroamines and the esters of nitric acid(V) and aliphatic polyalcohols).\nIn Poland, a&nbsp;research on new varieties of third generation explosives was started in the early 1970s at IPO (ammonium nitrate type) and at WAT (slurry and emulsion type). Based on the research, several modern versions of explosives were developed and brought into production to be used subsequently in the country's open and underground pits.\nThe paper presents the basic historical developments in the field of mining explosives, from black gunpowder to modern safe materials devoid of explosive constituents. Based on the author's own research, the physical and chemical properties of third generation explosives have been characterized in depth, such as ANFO, slurries and emulsions. Particular attention has been paid to the physical structure of mixtures, which plays a&nbsp;key role in determining their explosive characteristics.

            "abstract": "Gallium(III) salts have been explored for their antineoplastic properties since 60. of XX century, but clinical experience has revealed unfavorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic properties. Much of the present knowledge about the biodistribution of gallium compounds stems from the application of gallium radionuclides in tumor diagnosis. Half and century ago, when the affinity of gallium for bone was recognized, the use of gallium(III) radionuclides for diagnosis and radiotherapy of osteogenic sarcoma was first proposed. However, interest in the broader potential of gallium in tumor therapy has only been stimulated by the discovery of the antineo-plastic properties of cisplatin and the observation of a&nbsp;tendency of gallium to accumulate in various tumors, soft tissues and sites of inflammation. The concept of an investigation of antineoplastic gallium(III) complexes are essentially derived from experience with gallium(III) nitrate and chloride. Attempts to improve the pharmacological effects by changing the way of administration were granted insufficient success to justify further investigation as cancer therapeutics. However, recent years have seen renewed interest in gallium compounds, because the oral application of gallium(III) complexes with organic ligands has been recognized as a&nbsp;way to overcome the limitations of gallium(III) nitrate and chloride. Two of these gallium(III) complexes - gallium maltolate and KP46 - have reached the clinical trials. Gallium(III) complexes based on other ligands are noticeably underexplored.

            "abstract": "Motivation of the present paper is the new interest in the so called \"cold fusion\" of deuterium. The author, former electrochemist and presently a&nbsp;radiation chemist, was involved in writing a&nbsp;paper expressing criticism toward original Fleischmann and Pons [1], next called F&P \"discovery\", after experimental trials performed to repeat the claims. Actual efforts to revive an old idea of the D+D reaction in palladium electrode during electrolysis of heavy water consist in application of a&nbsp;new kind of palladium cathode, additional electric and magnetic fields around the electrolytic cell and experiments with polymeric detector, supposed to show nuclear disintegration of palladium and other strange nuclear transmutations. These new approaches to the almost twenty year old idea did not bring revelations in the field of energetics, therefore the nowadays reaction of popular media is far less enthusiastic than the original outburst of curiosity after the F&P paper. The author of the present paper analyses the artifacts and wishful thinking approach seen in publications, indicating that the problem of cold fusion is still unsolved, as it was at the beginning. The whole field belongs to the category of pathological science, like previously polywater, water with the memory of the solute present before dilution, etc..\nHowever, almost all other cases of pathological science have died quietly, the remaining interest in cold fusion asks for an explanation. The international conferences devoted to cold fusion convene frequently every second year or every year, the only change is, that recently the term cold fusion is no longer used but is substituted by enigmatic LENR (low energy nuclear reaction) and CANR (chemically assisted nuclear reaction). In the meantime between different versions of F&P approaches, another cold version of D+D fusion in perdeuterated acetone appeared as so called sonofusion, lasting as pathological science even shorter.\nFinancial support for cold fusion still exists, sometimes by organizations that wish to remain anonymous. The author of the review draws attention to the fact, that presently the majority of affiliations of authors of papers, and financial supports of civil laboratories are connected with military (USNavy) research and more general weaponry research, like in the case of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency). The reason is probably a&nbsp;hope, that creation of a&nbsp;true neutron bomb can be achieved, because the actual one is an ordinary nuclear device with enhanced yields of neutrons only. Vivid interest in cold fusion in Japan is connected with the fear, that some nuclear achievements may escape the attention, as it was the case of what happened in 1945.\nThe last but not least reason for the interest in cold fusion are the controversial European projects of ITER and HiPER trying to develop the high temperature fusion power plants, with an active zone of nuclear reaction heated to 100 million degrees K. Among many unsolved objections, the link between that zone and economic production of electric current is prohibited by actual physical and chemical laws. Therefore physicists involved in the projects are aware of difficulties and express interest in approaches to cold fusion ideas, especially in chemical aspects connected with solving, perhaps, difficult problems, e.g. from the area of material science. \t Keywords: cold fusion, deuterium-deuterium fusion, ITER, HiPER, military research, polywater, sonofusion, thermonuclear energy",

            "abstract": "This article concerns information on a&nbsp;synthesis, and structural and magnetic characterization of copper(II) compounds based on two classes of carboxylate ligands containing heterocyclic nitrogen atom of pyridine and quinoline i.e. pyridylo-2-carboxylate (2-picolinate, 2-pic) and quinolilo-2-carboxylate (2-chinaldynate, 2-qic), (Fig. 1, Tab. 1). Such compounds are products of a&nbsp;direct reaction of picolinate or chinaldynate acids with copper(II) salts [19, 37, 45, 48, 50, 51] and the hydrolytic [20, 52] and non hydrolytic [53] decomposition of ligands. Picolinate ion forms compounds of the general formula Cu(2-pic)2\u00b72H2O (1) or [Cu(2-pic)2Br2][(2-picH)2] (2). The compound of the formula Cu(pyridylo-2-carboxylate)2 exists in three polymorphic forms: monomeric (Cu(N2O2) chromophore) (3), and two (4 and 5) polymeric (1D) (Cu(N2O4) chromophore). With halide ions isostructural polymeric (2D) compounds of the formula Cu(2-pic)X, X= Cl (6) or Br (10) are formed (Cu(N2O2X) chromophore). However, with chinaldynate ion exist compounds of the stoichiometries: two isomeric forms of Cu(2-qic)2\u00b7H2O (7 and 8), which involve the same CuN2O3 chromophore (distortion isomers), and Cu(2-qic)X, X = Cl (9) and Br (11) compounds. The chloride and bromide (9 and 11) polymeric (2D) Cu(2-qic)X compounds, which crystal structure consists of two different chromophore Cu(N2O2X) and Cu(O2X2) are isostructural. Crystal structure of these copper-picolinate and copper-quinaldinate systems indicate, that carboxylate group in both ligands offers a&nbsp;variety of coordination modes leading to the formation of mononuclear and polynuclear compounds. The monomeric form of Cu(2-pic)2 (3) is an example of a&nbsp;square-planar copper(II) compound in which structure is achieved by important \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking intermolecular interaction. This interaction leads to antiferromagnetic coupling (J = -0.76 cm-1) [129]. The polymeric compounds of the formula Cu(2-pic)2 (4 and 5) are an example of an out-of-plane double carboxylato-bridged copper(II) compound resulting in the formation of an infinite chain. The magnetic properties revealed a&nbsp;weak intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling in both compounds (J = -0.73 and -1.04 cm-1 for 4 [48] and 5 [49], respectively). The structures of Cu(2-pic)X (6 and 10) and Cu(2-qic)X (9 and 11) compounds are based on syn-anti carboxylate bridge and additionally on halido-bridge. The carboxylate bridges transmit a&nbsp;weak ferromagnetic exchange (J -1) in both compounds [46, 47, 50]. For Cu(2-pic)X observed ferromagnetic coupling through dichloro-bridge (J = 15 cm-1) [46] is stronger than that through dibromo-bridge in bromide analog (J = 8.31 cm-1) [50]. For Cu(2-qic)X observed strong antiferromagnetic coupling through the single chloro-bridge (J = -57 cm-1) [47] is much weaker than that transmitted by the single bromo-bridge (J = -102.5 cm-1) [50]. The magnitude of the magnetic coupling through the non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking) is also discussed on the basis of the structural data [48, 49, 129, 130]. The magnitude of the exchange interactions between copper(II) ions are discussed on the basis of the molecular and crystal structures, in terms of bond properties and known theory of exchange [62-65, 100-104]. \u00a0Keywords: copper(II), carboxylate ligands, halide ligands, structure, magnetism",

            "abstract": "A combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters in one macromolecule of a&nbsp;polymer provides amphiphilic behavior [1, 2]. Such unique properties, which have found significant interest, are exhibited by graft copolymers containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as side chains attached to the backbone (Scheme 1) [20]. They have greatly expanded a&nbsp;class of materials important for science and biomedicine. This review article describes the PEO graft copolymers prepared by a&nbsp;variety of synthetic procedures used for the atom transfer radical (co)polymerization (ATRP) (Scheme 2) [15-17], i.e. directly by the grafting through, which is also named as the macromonomer method or by the grafting from technique, which requires the use of a&nbsp;multifunctional macroinitiator.\nDensely homografted copolymers also called molecular brushes [21-25] were obtained by homopolymerization of PEO macromonomer (Scheme 3). The density of PEO grafts was decreased in the copolymerization of PEO macromonomer with a&nbsp;low molecular weight comonomer resulting in loosely grafted copolymers contai-ning uniform PEO side chains (Scheme 4) [46-48]. Consequently, the copolymerization of two macromonomers yielded heterografted brushes (Scheme 5) [21, 23, 26, 45, 53-57]. In this case, the composition of copolymers was designed by the selection of proper comonomers with comparable (rM1 = rM2/rM1 ~ rM2) or different (rM1 > rM2, rM1 M2) reactivity ratios, which can form alternating/ random copolymers or spontaneous gradient of PEO chains along backbone, respectively. Using monofunctional macroinitiators with comb or linear composition for polymerization of PEO macromonomer resulted in comb-comb [31] or semi-comb diblock copolymers [21, 23, 27-30]. The reverse structures were also obtained, when the PEO graft copolymers were applied as the monofunctional macroinitiators [31, 32].\nThe use of polymeric multifunctional macroinitiators (graft or linear) in the polymerization of monomer or macromonomer led to the heterografted copolymers (Scheme 4) [32, 50, 51] or more complexed double grafted copolymers (Scheme 3) [25].\nThe applications of the PEO graft copolymers in numerous fields are also presented to show their versatile potential [25, 26, 46, 53, 55, 56, 68-76]. \u00a0Keywords: graft copolymers, amphiphilicity, PEO, ATRP",

These processes seem to be quite simple as they proceed without perturbation of bounding electrons and have low steric demands what enables study of their mechanism. However, many factors influences the mechanisms of these reactions. Among them and not the trifling ones, are dissociation-association effects accompanying them.\nThe definition, behavior and reactivity of carbon acids (C-acids) depending on the type of electron withdrawing group are given [1-57].

The introduction contains the description of basic terms used within the text, such as speciation, speciation analysis, hyphenated techniques, as well as provides the information on the reason of the studies on the chemical forms of selected elements [1-5].\nIn the Chapters 1, 2 and 3, the characterization of three essential non-metallic elements - nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur, is presented. The importance of non-metals for life, especially their involvement in ATP, ADP, nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipides and sulpholipides, is highlighted. From the analyzed chemical forms of nitrogen, the most important from the point of speciation analysis, are nitrite and nitrate form of this element. Within the Chapter 1, the studies on the former are reviewed, with the accent on their analysis (Table 1) in medicinal plant raw materials and in herbal drugs [29-35]. Chapter 2 describes the investigation on chemical forms of phosphorus, from them the most important - inorganic phosphate phosphorus [38-41, 46]. The chemical forms of nitrogen and phosphorus are related also to the indexes of ADI and RDA, to give the knowledge on their potential impact on human's health. Chapter 3 is focussed on sulphur and its chemical forms - inorganic and organic sulphur in plant material [53, 54]. Special attention to potentially dangerous for human chemical form of sulphur - SO2 in several Chinese herbs [59] is paid on.\nChapter 4 concerns the analysis of chemical forms of iron, selected as characteristic example of an essential metallic elements, and is based on the studies of Fe and other metals concentration in crude drugs as well as in infusions, decoctions and herbal teas (Table 2), providing also evaluation of the extraction efficacy of iron with the comparison with the other important elements [65, 66].\nIn the Chapter 5, the examples of speciation studies of other metals (Mn, Zn, Mg, Pt and other) are discussed [82-101]. The analytical methodology, including speciation scheme for selected metals, especially in plant materials used in medicine, is given. Hyphe-nated techniques, such as HPLC with combination of different detection techniques (spectroscopic, electrochemical) applied for the speciation analysis of metals in plant material, are reviewed.\nThe Summary contains the final remarks and conclusions on the described examples of speciation studies of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, iron and other selected metallic elements important for life, as well as perspectives for the further development of analysis of their chemical forms in the future. \u00a0Keywords: Chemical forms of N, P, S and Fe, speciation analysis, plant material, medicinal plant raw materials, herbal drugs",

The etched insoluble amorphous residue that stays solid up to 260\u00b0C and reveals carbonyl absorption in IR, when subjected to transesterification in methanol at reflux in the presence of sodium methoxide yielded quantitatively a&nbsp;soluble in chloroform product, which shows an optical activity and proved to be a&nbsp;difficult to separate mixture of methyl esters and alcoholic moiety. The etching of the raw resin with hot water gave an optically inactive mixture of double homologues of poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene) glycol structure, that differ one from the other in a&nbsp;number of methylene and oxyethylene groups. The product revealed a&nbsp;characteristic ESI-MS spectrum, the pattern of which could be seen in almost every fraction obtained by extraction of the raw resin with different organic solvents or its transesterification product mixture. The physical properties, other than ESI-MS, showed in the resinous material the presence of some additional components different from polyethylene-polypropylene glycol homologues. The polyurethane character of the resin was demonstrated by identification of bis(4-isocyanatophenyl)methane in the chloroform extract of the raw resin as a&nbsp;secondary product formed in the thermal conditions of GC-MS, and of bis[4-(methoxycarbonylamino)phenyl]methane which occurred in the transesterification product mixture. Additionally, the presence of methyl 9-octadecenoate, accompanied by methyl esters of other fatty acids, was also determined. Finally, after several repeated column and plate chromatographic separations, two \"homogeneous\" substances of [\u03b1]D = +25.7\u00b0 and +20.2\u00b0, respectively, the main components responsible for the optical activity of most resinous fractions, were isolated from the transesterification product mixture. The principal products of these \"chromatographically pure\" substances turned out to have the adduct structure of methyl ricinoleate and bis(4-isocyanatophenyl)methane. It was proved that in the case of a&nbsp;compound revealing the higher specific rotation, two molecules of methyl ricinoleate were bound, using their OH functions, to one molecule of diisocyanate, giving bis[4-(1-methoxy-1-oxo-9-octadecen-12-yloxycarbonylamino)phenyl]methane. The molecular structure of a&nbsp;compound with lower specific rotation was composed of one molecule of methyl ricinoleate and one molecule of methanol, both bound to diisocyanate to give [4-(1-methoxycarbonylamino)phenyl][4-(1-methoxy-1-oxo-9-octadecen-12-yloxycarbonylamino)phenyl]methane. No components were found of a&nbsp;struc-ture which might indicate the ancient, natural origin of the resinous material. \u00a0Keywords: resinous inclusions in coal, poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxypropylene) glycol, double homologue mixture, methyl ricinoleate, urethanes derived from bis(4-isocyanatophenyl)methane, ESI mass spectra",

Their coordination chemistry, photophysics, synthesis, chemical transformations, electrochemistry and other properties have recently been studied in great detail [7-11]. Discovered in 1964 [15], for many years they have been mainly synthesized via a,c-biladienes cyclization [19-20]. Multistep a,c-biladienes preparation discouraged broader range of chemists from studying corroles (Scheme 2).\nSince initial reports by Gross [17, 18] and Paolesse [16] revealing one-pot syntheses of meso-substituted corroles from aldehydes and pyrrole, this reaction has been subjected to many refining studies (Scheme 4, 5; Table 2) [23-28]. As a&nbsp;result yields have been improved to ~ 15%. The one-pot synthesis of meso-substitued A3-corroles from aldehydes and pyrroles consists of two independent steps. The first step is an acid-mediated electrophilic substitution to yield a&nbsp;mixture of various aldehyde-pyrrole oligocondensates including bilane (tetrapyrrane) - the direct precursor of corrole (Scheme 6). The second step is the oxidative ring-closure. Maximizing bilane formation while minimizing the formation of dipyrromethanes, tripyrrane and higher oligocondensate is a&nbsp;difficult task due to the similar reactivity of all these compounds [30-32].\nRecently new and efficient conditions for the synthesis of meso-substituted corroles have been developed [33]. The first step, namely the reaction of aldehydes with pyrrole, was carried out in a&nbsp;water-methanol mixture in the presence of HCl. a&nbsp;relatively narrow distribution of aldehyde-pyrrole oligocondensates was controlled by their solubility in the reaction medium. After thorough optimization of various reaction parameters high yields of bilanes were obtained. As a&nbsp;result, many A3-corroles were obtained in the highest yield (~25-30%) reported to date.\nCorroles bearing two various substituents at meso positions were synthesized for the first time from dipyrromethanes and aldehydes (Scheme 10) [35]. This method continues to prevail in the literature [36-38]. Performance of this reaction in H2O/MeOH/HCl mixtures allows to obtain trans-A2B-corroles in yields up to 56% (Scheme 11) [33]. Last developments in the chemistry of corroles make these compounds more accessible than respective porphyrins. \u00a0Keywords: corroles, porphyrins, electrophilic substitution, macrocyclization, oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Design and synthesis of redox active binuclear complexes in which metal centres are linked via bridging ligands enabling electronic and magnetic interactions between them are crucial for an understanding of key processes in chemistry and biology. In biological systems, such as proteins, electron transfer involves a&nbsp;charge transport over a&nbsp;considerable distance (>10 \u00c5) [8-11,13-19]. On the other hand, long range electronic interactions are central in the development of potential elements for molecular electronics like molecule-sized wires, diodes, light activated switches, transistors (Fig. 1), logic gates etc. [1-7].\nThis article reviews some of the work performed in the area of bimetallic nitrosyl molybdenum complexes containing tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)hydroborato ligand (Fig. 4). Numerous examples of mixed-valence species have been described, showing a&nbsp;wide range of behaviour from fully delocalized to valence-trapped systems of which electrochemical (voltammetry, Fig. 3), spectroscopic (EPR (Fig. 5), IR and UV-Vis/NIR spectroscopy) and magnetic susceptibility were studied. These results are summarised in Table 1. Many such complexes show exceptionally strong electrochemical (\u0394Ef) and magnetic exchange interactions (J) between metal centres depending on the features of the bridging ligand such as length, degree of conjugation, dihedral angles between aromatic rings, substitution pattern, and symmetry [28, 41]. For example, in [{Mo(NO)(TpMe2)Cl}2{4,4'-bipy}] (Fig. 9) \u0394Ef equals 765 mV, being an order of magnitude greater when compared to the {Ru(NH3)5}2+/3+ analogue, and J = -33 cm-1 [43, 68, 69]. Using 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipy as a&nbsp;bridge forces a&nbsp;twist between the two pyridyl rings and decreases both \u0394Ef and J down to 380 mV and 3.5 cm-1, respectively [42, 71]. The introduction of a&nbsp;saturated section into the bridge, which breaks the conjugation, e.g. in 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligand, considerably decreases \u0394Ef (105 mV) but does not exclude electronic and magnetic through-bridge interactions [43]. Recently a&nbsp;series of bimetallic complexes based on {Mo(NO)(TpMe2)}2+ centres comprising n-alkanediolate bridges (Fig. 12) have been prepared. These species exhibited intermediate metal-metal interactions (310 mV in ethane-1,2-diolate) [54, 55] which prompted investigation of electronic interactions through saturated alkyl chains by DFT [64]. \u00a0Keywords: molybdenum nitrosyl complexes, bimetallic complexes, tris(pyrazolyl)borato complexes, electronic interactions, magnetic interactions.",

            "abstract": "Extensive studies of complexes of titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) alkoxides with O-donor ligands observed for the last few years are a&nbsp;result of their wide applications in nanomaterial technologies. Various physicochemical properties of TiO2 and ZrO2 including high reference factor (n = 2,616-2,903 TiO2), low absorption in visible range, photoluminescence, high dielectric constant (\u03b5TiO2 = 120 for rutile), high stability and chemical resistance have significant influence on their use. Thin metal oxide layers are prepared by vaporization and condensation methods [1], hydrolysis in the flame [2], vacuum deposition, sol-gel techniques, and also chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The last two methods are most often used to prepare high quality ceramic materials, thin metal oxide layers, organic-inorganic hybrid polymers, dopped materials (M2O/M'; M = Ti, Zr; M' = Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd) as well as mesoporous materials [3-15]. In both techniques a&nbsp;very important role is played by precursors, which influence CVD process, and the structure of deposited layers.\nTi(IV) and Zr(IV) alkoxides (M(OR)4) are usually used as CVD precursors of thin TiO2 and ZrO2 layers. However, high reactivity of M(OR)4 towards nucleophilic reagents, in particularly hydrolysis and condensation of metal alkoxides, lead to precipitation of oxo-polymers. In order to stabilize the alkoxo precursor, Ti(IV) and Zr(IV) complexes containing anionic bidendate groups, such as \u03b2-diketones, carboxylates, alkylamides, sulfonates have been studied [14-17]. In the presented paper, the review of synthetic methods and structural characterization of the following type of complexes [M(OR)4-x(L)x] (M = Ti(IV), Zr(IV), OR = alkoxo ligand, L = \u03b2-diketones, carboxylates) has been carried out. The volatile properties of these compounds as well as their low reactivity towards water caused that above mentioned complexes are used as TiO2 and ZrO2 precursors in CVD processes and therefore a&nbsp;special attention has been paid to this problem.\nSubstitution of alkoxo groups by \u03b2-diketonate ligands in the alkoxide/\u03b2-diketonate molar ratio of 1:1 makes possible the synthesis of monomeric complexes of the general formula [Ti(OR) 2 (\u03b2-diketonate) 2]. The use of an excess of \u03b2-diketonate (1:2) leads to the formation of dimeric complexes ([Ti(OR)3(\u03b2-diketonate)] 2 (Fig. 2) [27]. Sensitivity of these compounds to moisture was significant lower than the parent Ti(IV) alkoxides. Suitable volatility of the mentioned complexes and thermal decomposition to TiO2 caused that their use as CVD precursors is possible. Deposition experiments proved that pure TiO2 layers of anatase form were obtained at temperatures higher than 573 K using [Ti(dpm) 2 (OiPr)v] [25] and [Ti(mpd)(mdop)(m-OMe)] 2 [93] as precursors.\nFrom Zr(IV) \u03b2-diketonate derivatives, only [Zr(OR) 2 (thd) 2] (R = OiPr, tBu) and [Zr(OiPr)3(thd)] 2 were used for the deposition of ZrO2 by CVD methods [98]. According to the literature reports, above mentioned \u03b2-diketonates were less reactive and easier to handle than parent alkoxides, but their volatility was significantly lower. ZrO2 layers were also prepared using [Zr(acac) 2 (hfip) 2] but in deposited films, traces of fluorine contaminations were observed [103].\nOxo-alkoxo carboxylate Ti(IV) derivatives were synthesized in reactions of Ti(IV) alkoxides with carboxylic acids (Fig. 4). The structure of these complexes consists of oxo-metallic skeletons (Fig. 5), which size and structure depends on (a) metal alkoxide/carboxylic acid molar ratio, (b) type of alkoxide and carboxylate ligand, and (c) reaction temperature. Results of these works suggest that Ti(IV) complexes, which structure consists of [Ti6O6(OR4)6(OOCR')6] (R = OiPr, nBu, iBu, R' = H, Me, tBu, CH2tBu, C(CH3)2Et, C6H4Oph) clusters are the most stable (Fig. 7) [34, 44]. These types of Ti(IV) complexes were also prepared in the reaction of Ti(IV) trimethylsiloxide with 2 fold exces of organic acids [45]. Thermolysis of [Ti6O6(OR4)6(OOCR')6] proceeds with their partialy decomposition and formation of a&nbsp;volatile and stable Ti(IV) alkoxide and Ti(IV) carboxylate [43]. Results of CVD experiments confirm that these types of complexes have promising properties as titanium dioxide precursors [88, 94]. Thin titanium dioxide films have been deposited in the temperature range 673-873 K on Si(111) substrates. The structure and surface morphology of the layers change with an increase of temperature from the large grain of TiO2 anatase (TD = 713-733 K), to close-packed crystals of rutile form (TD = 853-873 K).\nA result of the reaction of Zr(IV) alkoxides with organic acids are oxo/hydroxo Zr(IV) carboxylate or oxo/hydroxo Zr(IV) carboxylate alkoxides (Fig. 9) [57-59]. Their low volatility and high thermal stability makes them unsuitable for CVD processes. Application of fluorinated carboxylate ligands increases the volatility of these compounds. ZrO2 layers have been deposited by CVD using ([Zr6O4(OH)4(OiPr)6(OOCR')6] (R' = C2F5, C3F7) as precursors, at ~853 K. Analysis of the literature data showed that carboxylate substituted oxozirconium complexes can be applied for the preparation of inorganic-organic hybrid polymers [104, 105].\t \u00a0Keywords: titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) complexes, crystal structure, IR, NMR, thermal properties .",

Its aim is the development of highly sensitive and selective receptors [2, 3]. The redox-active receptors usually consist of two units: the guest binding site and the redox-active unit. After complexation of a&nbsp;guest at the binding site, the changes of the electrochemical properties of redox-active center give information about the complexation.

Receptors able to recognize cations are presented according to the mechanism of a&nbsp;communication between redox-active and binding units. These mechanisms are: through bonds communication, through space communication, direct coordination of a&nbsp;cation to redox-active center and the conformational change of redox-center mechanism.\nIn the next chapter are discussed the redox-active receptors for anions according to the type of the redox-active center. In complexation of anionic guests the major role plays the possibility of the creation of hydrogen bonds between anion and receptor.\nThe most extensively studied redox center was ferrocen.

            "abstract": "Among organophosphorus biocides (OPB), VX is the most toxic, but multi-ton production of less toxic OP pesticides, solvents, plasticizers, and engine anti-wear additives as well as their precursors can also have a&nbsp;detrimental impact on our health. V-gases have been feared as the \"nuclear weapon\" of poorer nations and terrorist groups because their manufacturing is relatively simple and the starting materials are readily available. Comparison of toxicity of OPB, of both synthetic and natural origin is presented in Table 1.\nIt is well-known that some OBP were used in ophtalmology. Rationally designed OBP can be active in treatment of Alzheimer or Parkinson disease [9-11] or as \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor in the future [12].\nThe extreme toxicity of V-gases often mandates research laboratories to employ safer model compounds called simulants instead of the actual compounds. Some examples of recently involved simulants are presented (Fig. 3) and the influence of their structure on reactivity is reported [13-14].\nMany efforts have recently been performed in order to find new and effective methods of detection of OPB and their degradation products (Ch. 4). Although sophisticated chromatographic techniques are involved [15], they are not optimal for rapid detection. The most promising methods seem to be antibody-based recognition [18] and the use of chemical [17] and biological sensors [19].\nA great deal of work is devoted to develop efficient methods capable of eliminating persistent OPB under comparatively mild conditions. Chemical methods with the emphasis on nucleophile promoted hydrolysis are the most preffered reaction. Especially, supernucleophilic reagents facilitate OPB hydrolysis and some of them act as strong oxidants [25-27]. Otherwise, enzyme-like systems including micelles and microemulsions have been used in decomposition by nucleophiles. It was found that OPB methanolysis can be accelerated with the use of lanthanium and cupric ions by a&nbsp;factor of 109 [29-32]. The use of reactive polymers, which are prone to transesterification [28] is quite a&nbsp;novel approach to the detoxification of OPB. This methodology allows immobilizing phosphoric residue on polymeric particles and completely removes OPB from their solutions (Fig. 6). Detoxification of VX is an extremely serious, yet unsolved scientific problem. Its hydrolysis (and oxidation) is a&nbsp;relatively slow process and proceeds to the formation of other toxic compounds (Fig. 5) [22]. a&nbsp;number of groups have looked at the creation of catalytic antibodies which can be used for the degradation of VX [13, 37-38]. Haptens bearing amine oxides, phosphorane and \u03b1-hydroxyphosphinate structures have been designed for the selection of antibodies in order to hydrolyse paraoxone and VX, respectivily (Fig. 8 and 9). Also, considerable efforts have been made concerning the hydrolysis of V-gases with enzymes [33-36].\nUntil now, reactivation of AChE is realized by only one family of antidotes known as pyridinum oximes although some improvements of their structure have been made [39-41] (Fig. 10).\nStudies of uncatalyzed [44, 48-52] and enzymatic phosphoryl transfer (PT) and thiophosphoryl group transfer reaction [43-47] have been undertaken in various laboratories in an effort to understand the mechanism of this important biological process.\nAdditionally, few examples of improvements in OPB synthesis are presented (Fig. 13) which could have the influence on the progress in OPB-based research. \u00a0Keywords: phosphoroorganic biocides, phosphoryl transfer reaction, chemical and biological methods for the detection and detoxication of biocides, AChE inhibitors and reactivators.",

            "abstract": "This review attempts to briefly summarise the developments in anti-HIV therapy. The main attention was paid to the inhibitors of the virus enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT).\nUntil 1987, no anti-HIV drug has been available, but an understanding of life cycle of HIV has led to an identification of several possible drug targets. At present, most drugs that have been developed act against the viral enzymes: reverse transcriptase, protease, as well as integrase. However, a&nbsp;serious problem with HIV treatment is that the virus undergoes mutations extremely easy. This results in rapid resistance to antiviral drugs.\nNon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI's) have, in addition to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors, gained a&nbsp;definite position in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. To date three NNRTIs: Nevirapine, Delaviridine and Efavirenz have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use [3-8].\nNNRTIs snugly fit into a&nbsp;specific allosteric \"pocket\", located at some 10 \u00c5 from the catalytic site, of HIV-1 RT and thus disrupt its enzymatic activity [5-7, 17, 18]. Several studies have revealed a&nbsp;common mode of binding for chemically diverse compounds with their target site at the RT [5]. The inhibitors cause a&nbsp;repositioning of the three-stranded sheet in the p66 subunit containing the catalytic aspartic acid residues 110, 185 and 186. This suggests that NNRTIs inhibit HIV-1 RT by locking the active catalytic site in an inactive conformation. When bound into their pocket at the HIV-1 RT, the inhibitors maintain a&nbsp;very similar \"butterfly-like\" conformation. They roughly overlay each other in the binding pocket and appear to function as \u03c0-electron donors to aromatic side-chain residues surrounding the pocket [5].\nDrug resistance is a&nbsp;key failure for treatment of HIV infection. The torsional flexibility of the inhibitors can generate numerous conformational variants and the compactness of the inhibitors permits significant repositioning and reorientation within the pocket. So, in this perspective, various new prototypes of NNRTI's were reported as potential lead compounds [20]. For example, Capravirine, Dapivirine as well as thiazolidinones belong to this group [24-29]. \u00a0Keywords: anti-HIV drugs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "The monograph gives a&nbsp;review of literature on porphyrinoids containing an ace-tylene unit attached at macrocyclic perimeter or built into a&nbsp;coordination core. The inclusion of an acetylene fragment provides an unusual structural motif because of its symmetrical cylindrical structure, coordination ability towards metal ions and reactivity.\nThe synthesis, coordination properties and reactivity of porphyrin analogs with an ethynylene unit embedded in the macrocyclic skeleton have been described. Most of such macrocycles belong to stretched porphycenes and heteroporphycenes [8, 9]. The distinct class of expanded porphyrin analogs is delivered by very stable cyclooligothiophenediacetylenes with different size of the interior cavity [16]. a&nbsp;novel type of contracted heteroporphyrins namely dithiaethyneporphyrins, with an acetylene moiety introduced instead of one of pyrrole units, has been also characterized [17, 18]. These macrocycles display unique features of an [18]triphyrin(4.1.1) frame.\nThe introduction of an alkyne moiety outside porphyrinic macrocycle yields meso- or \u03b2-alkynylporphyrins [38-42, 71-75]. The synthetic pathways and spectroscopic properties of alkynylporphyrins are included in the second part of the presented review. These macrocycles are widely used as building blocks in the construction of conjugated oligomeric and polymeric porphyrins and metalloporphyrins [81-85, 89-93]. Moreover, the paper provides classification of such \u03c0 conjugated systems, which are extensively explored in the analysis of charge or electron density transfer due to the strong electronic conjugation of acetylene with the \u03c0 system of the porphyrin ring. \u00a0Keywords: porphyrins, heteroporphyrins, carbaporphyrinoids, alkynylporphyrins, expanded porphyrins, contracted porphyrins.",

            "abstract": "Porous carbonaceous materials are widely used in everyday life and industry because they possess very high surface area, pore volume and unique physicochemical properties, including high adsorption capacity for many organic molecules. Porous carbons have been prepared for hundreds of years, however traditional methods used for their preparation allow rather for a&nbsp;limited control of pore sizes and volumes of micropores and mesopores, which in fact results in a&nbsp;broad distribution of pore sizes. The most common applications of porous carbons include adsorption, catalysis, gas storage, purification of air and water and electrochemical applications [1, 2].\nThis article presents a&nbsp;survey of literature devoted to new methods of synthesis and characterization of mesoporous carbonaceous materials. One of the major topics reviewed in this article is the synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC) with a&nbsp;help of ordered mesoporous silicas (OMS) (Fig. 1) [7, 25], colloidal silica (Fig. 2 and 3) [11, 29, 40, 59] and colloidal silica crystals as hard templates [57]. In addition to the synthesis of OMC, this paper presents an overview of physicochemical properties of OMC, especially adsorption properties. The exemplary characteristics, which include BET surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution, are provided for selected carbon materials [29].\nA special emphasis was placed on the method, which employs monolithic siliceous templates obtained by pressing colloidal silica followed by their impregnation with oxalic acid (catalyst), resorcinol and formaldehyde (carbon precursors), polymerization of carbon precursors, carbonization and template removal (Fig. 4) [60]. This method affords carbons with uniform spherical mesopores as well as carbon composites with inorganic nanoparticles (e.g., silver), which after additional activation (e.g., with KOH) give micro and mesoporous carbons with superior structural characteristics. a&nbsp;set of basic parameters for one of these carbons includes: the diameter of spherical pores of 26,8 nm, the BET surface area of 1300 m2/g and the single-point (total) pore volume of 4,3 cm3/g; however, only 0,19 cm3/g of the total pore volume belongs to micropores. After KOH activation the volume of micropores increased to 0,8 cm3/g, the BET surface area increased to 2300 m2/g, but the volume of mesopores was reduced to 1,8 cm3/g [60].\nAnother important topic reviewed in this article is the synthesis of mesoporous carbons from thermosetting polymers (e.g., phenolic resins) used as carbon precursors in the presence of block copolymers used as soft templates (Fig. 5) [29, 78, 79]. This new synthetic strategy affords mesoporous carbons in the form of monoliths, fibers and films and permits to scale up this process. Additional activation of the resulting carbons with KOH (Fig. 7) affords micro and mesoporous carbons with high surface area and large volumes of both types of pores, improving significantly their adsorption properties. a&nbsp;set of basic parameters for one of the soft-templated carbons includes: the BET surface area of about 500 m2/g, the total pore volume of 0,7 cm3/g and the pore width of about 9,7 nm. After KOH activation the BET surface area increased to about 900 m2/g, the total pore volume and the volume of micropores increased to 0,9 cm3/g and 0,22 cm3/g, respectively [79].\nNovel ordered mesoporous carbons are not only attractive materials for various advanced applications but also for the development of accurate methods for characterization of porous solids. This article shows that in addition to such important characterization methods as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), adsorption of nitrogen, argon and other adsorbates (Fig. 8) is one of the key methods for the pore structure analysis, especially for the assessment of global properties of porous materials. \u00a0Keywords: mesoporous carbonaceous materials, synthesis, properties, porous structure.",

We start from historical review of the concept of BSU (Fig. 1) [4, 5, 8-12] and models based on microcrystallites (Figs. 2 and 3). We show the most popular methods of investigation applied in the field of carbon chemistry (Tab. 1). The structure of common surface acidic and basic functional groups containing oxygen are discussed (Figs. 5 and 7), taking into account the basicity of carbon \u03c0-electrons forming the structure. Next, we show how carbon porosity can be modelled. The basic computer simulation methods applied for recovering of the structure and studying of adsorption on carbons are discussed (mainly GCMC and MD). Here also DFT and some recently proposed new Monte Carlo-type methods are shortly discussed. Next the concepts of modelling of carbon porosity are presented (Fig. 8). First models of ideal pores are discussed showing the approach of infinite and finite carbon pores. Next we discuss the concepts of finite graphitic pores and the methods of modelling. Based on literature we divide current construction methods of models of carbons. Discussing of the current approaches we start from the models of Bakaev [104], Segarra and Glandt [105], Dahn et al. [107], and Seaton et al. [108]. Next we discuss in detail the newest models proposed by Biggs et al. [53-57] (Figs. 9 and 10), Do et al. [58-61] (Figs. 11 and 12), Gubbins et al. [39, 62-69] (Fig. 13) and Harris et al. [8, 12, 70-77] (Figs. 15 and 16). All mentioned models are discussed with some nuances. Also some less popular models are mentioned, including those proposed by Acharya et al., Gavald et al., Cascarini de Torre et al., Smith and Kumar et al. Since carbon surface functionalities are discussed in the paper finally some results obtained from molecular simulations of adsorption on carbons are presented especially the results of simulations of water adsorption.

            "abstract": "Hydrogen bonds play a&nbsp;key role in interactions in biological structures, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal engineering [28, 29]. The development of supramolecular structure created by hydrogen bonds is a&nbsp;new challenge for the synthesis of materials, in order to study their magnetic behaviour [59, 62]. a&nbsp;role played by hydrogen bonds in the transmission of magnetic interactions is still not fully understood, but the number of magnetically coupled hydrogen-bonded systems is growing.\nThe present paper describes magnetic properties of copper(II) complexes [33] with nitrobenzoate and salicylate ligands where the system of hydrogen bonds O-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O is the only path of magnetic interaction. Magnetic measurements in the temperature range 1.8-300 K show magnetic phase-transition at 6 K to antiferromagnetically coupled CuII dimers with singlet-tryplet energy gap 2J = -6.26 cm-1.\nA variety of different supramolecular hydrogen bond structures [27, 33-52, 57-62] and significant changes in their magnetic properties were analyzed to show the role of hydrogen bonds in magnetic interactions. Magnetostructural correlation has been made taking into account both covalently bridging ligand and the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. An evidence for hydrogen-bond-mediated exchange coupling has been observed in magnetic study as well as in DFT calculations [40, 48].\nIntermolecular interaction has been generally treated as a&nbsp;nuance, but today, it has established itself as an important functional tool, tunable at will [59] in the design of nanosized magnetic materials and their dimensionally-expanded compounds [57-62]. Intermolecular magnetic exchange interactions through hydrogen bonds, can have a&nbsp;large influence on the quantum properties of single molecular magnets SMMs [59]. Hydrogen bonding leads to coupling of the magnetic effects of individual SMMs units and to different quantum behaviour. Even very weak hydrogen bond inter-molecular interactions demonstrate a&nbsp;possibility of switching from an original nanosized magnetic system to a&nbsp;correlated system, for example, from single molecule magnet SMM to single chain magnet SCM or from such nanosized magnets to a&nbsp;bulk magnet [59]. \u00a0Keywords: copper(II) complexes, intermolecular magnetic exchange interactions, hydrogen bonds, nanosized magnetic materials.",

            "abstract": "The previous two decades have witnessed a&nbsp;series of major breakthroughs in carbon allotrope chemistry [1, 2]. This field has attracted scientists from all disciplines and plays a&nbsp;leading role in the nanotechnology boom. a&nbsp;lot of discussion is devoted to the new polymeric sp carbon allotrope termed \"carbyne\", which until now remains an unsettled topic. In order to model and understand its potential properties research on known - natural and synthetic - polyynes or polyynediyl systems has been undertaken.\nThe review gives a&nbsp;brief summary on the results of this research. It describes isolation and properties of many natural polyynes. This includes diynes [13-21], triynes [22-26], and tetraynes [27, 28], which were derived from many natural sources [6-10]. Most of these compounds possess very interesting biological activities that range from antibacterial properties through antifunginal, antiseptic, anti-cancer and anti-HIV activity [11-12].\nNext some of the synthetic organic and organometallic examples are presented. The former includes compounds with more than 20 carbon atoms in the chain that are often terminated with extremely bulky (even dendrimeric) [29-38] or heteroatom containing endgroups [39-45]. Such compounds constitute an ideal base for many theoretic calculations.\nThe classification of alkynyl complexes is given as well as few examples of crystallographically characterized long carbon chain organometallic compounds [55-56]. The review differentiates the complexes of main group and transition metals. The former are less represented but are often crucial in the synthesis of transition metal alkynyl complexes [57-60].\nNext we summarized the most practical approaches to the synthesis of polyynes. The common pathway includes four steps: (1) synthesis of terminal group precursor, (2) introduction of acetylene fragment, (3) chain elongation, and (4) termination of the carbon chain including dimerization.\nMethods for C?C introduction to organic compounds are represented by numerous homo and heterocoupling protocols. The most frequently used are Sonogashira [64-66] and Stille [67, 68] couplings although in some cases other methods (Negishi, Kumada-Tamao-Corriu or Suzuki coupling) are more effective. Instead, conventional synthesis of alkynyl complexes includes reaction of metal halides with common alkynylating agents as alkynyl compounds of group 1 metals [71-73] although more sophisticated methods are also known [74-82].\nChain elongation is the most important part of the polyyne synthesis. The major protocol for this step is Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling first introduced in 1957 [83]. Lately, many modifications of this method were developed although the main idea remained unchanged [84-87]. With time some other protocols were applied for this step from which the most interesting are Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell [89-91] and elimination reaction [92-93].\nFinally, organic and organometallic polyynes application potential is discussed. Apart from their use in synthetic organic chemistry [99-113] they are being utilized for the production of polymeric materials via topochemical crystal-to-crystal polymerization [118-120]. They also reveal some medical applicability [114-115]. \u00a0Keywords: polyynes, Sonogashira coupling, Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, topochemical polymerization, polyyne complexes.",

            "abstract": "Leprosy is a&nbsp;chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae which has been plaguing mankind for ages. The first effective medicine to treat that illness was dapsone (1946) and it has been used until now [1]. Since then, there has been developed only one more new drug, clofazimine (1), which is, together with dapsone, listed as medicine used to cure leprosy (J 04 BA).\nThe other drugs which are currently employed in leprosy therapy used to be utilised in treatment of other bacterial diseases.\nClofazimine (1) was first synthesised in 1954 and has marked antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects [2-8]. The method of preparation of clofazimine (1) consists of two stages (Scheme 1) [9, 10].\nMinocycline (3) is a&nbsp;semisynthetic antibiotic of the tetracycline group with the mycobactericidal activity, obtained by chemical modification of tetracycline derivatives [11-13]. The substrates to synthesise minocycline are the metabolism products of S. aureofaciens or S. psammoticus - 6-demethyltetracycline (4a) or 7-chloro-6-demethyltetracycline (4b) [14-16]. 6-Demethyl-6-deoxyteracycline (5) is obtained as a&nbsp;result of reduction of compounds 4a and 4b, which may be transformed in several ways into minocycline (3) (Scheme 2, 3, 4) [17-30].\nAmongst the macrolide antibiotics also the semisynthetic derivatives of erythromycin A, such as clarithromycin (15), azitromycin (16) and telithromycin (17) show some anti-leprosy features [12, 26, 32, 33]. Telithromycin (17) was introduced to medicine in 1995 and belongs to the group of ketolides, the latest generation of macrolides [12, 39, 40-45].\nFollowing the in vitro and in vivo research it has been stated that the fluoroquinolones demonstrate mycobactericidal activity (Table 1) [47-51]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the use of fluoroquinolones in the multidrug therapy (MDT) together with other chemotherapeutics [108-113].\nRifampicin (26), a&nbsp;drug from the ansamycin antibiotic group, turned out to be an extremely effective weapon against leprosy [72, 73]. It is produced by chemical modification of a&nbsp;fermentation product of S. mediterranei [31, 74]. Rifampicin derivatives rifapentine (27) and rifabutin (28) are manifesting strong reactivity against Mycobacterium leprae, sometimes even surpassing rifampicin (26) (Table 2) [31, 72].\nIn the treatment of leprosy it is important to cure not only the causes but also the effects of the disease. That is why a&nbsp;wide range of complementary drugs is introduced. Especially steroids such as prednisolone (30), prednisone (31), dexamethasone (32) and fusidic acid (34) are important. The enumerated above steroids have strong anti-inflammatory effects as well as prevent nerve damage leading to smaller and lesser disability [2, 85]. Dexamethasone (32) is particularly efficient in conjunction with azathioprine (33) [90]. In the case of fusidic acid (34) it has been proved that it reveals weak bacteriostatic activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, including Mycobacterium leprae [7, 26].\nLeprosy treatment involves the use of huge doses of bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs what may lead to a&nbsp;life-threatening shock. In such circumstances, the most valuable medicine seems to be thalidomide (35) [82, 102-105].\nWHO has prepared some programmes of leprosy treatment, recommending a&nbsp;diversion from a&nbsp;single drug to multidrug therapy (MDT). Implementation of the MDT therapy brings about numerous advantages such as economic advantages, shortening of treatment time and particular drug resistance prevention [7, 11, 107-109].\nLeprosy, despite the tiny number of effective medicines, is totally curable. There have been continuous signals about utilising common and popular antibacterial drugs in leprosy treatment. Yet, it should be taken into consideration, that all action taken against that disease is limited to fighting bacteria but not preventing transmission. \u00a0Keywords: leprosy, antileprosy drug, multidrug therapy, Mycobacterium leprae.",

            "abstract": "Synthesis of biopolymers (peptides, proteins and nucleic acids) has long been in the range of interest of numerous chemists. The primary structure of biomolecules consists of linear and repeating sequences of monomeric units (aminoacids, nucleic bases, sugars) in a&nbsp;specifically determined orientation. Therefore, chemical synthesis of biopolymers comprises a&nbsp;lot of identical, repetitive steps (condensation, chain elongation and purification).\nSolid phase method is currently used also for the oligonucleotide [2, 3] (Figure 1) and oligosaccharide synthesis. There exist interesting applications of analogous approach to combinatorial synthesis of small molecules (Solid Phase Organic Chemistry - SPOC) [4, 5].\nAutomation of the phosphoramidite method of oligonucleotide synthesis process proposed by Caruthers [6] made an enormous impact on biological, medical and biotechnological sciences. It is beyond any doubt that this is the fastest and the most convenient method of oligonucleotide synthesis aimed at biological research. Solid phase synthesis has many advantages, however, it is not free of drawbacks either.\nDepending on the synthesis method, various types of supports are used. An ideal support should have an appropriate and reactive chemical group on its surface, e.g. -NH2, -OH, -COOH, by means of which it is connected to the linker and the first unit of the monomer. Surface functionalization of the solid phase determines the number of available reactive groups and characterizes support loading expressed in micromoles per gram.\nNucleosides are attached to the support by a&nbsp;linker, the choice of which depends on the reaction conditions. The linker arm must be designed in such a&nbsp;way that it is adjusted to the cleavage conditions and deprotection procedures.\nDepending on the synthesis purpose and the type of a&nbsp;oligonucleotide, various linker arms are used. They include: linker arms cleaved after synthesis, labile linker arms, universal linkers [21, 22], and the linker arms for deprotection of the immobilized products [26, 27].\nAmong numerous methods of oligonucleotide synthesis, the phosphoramidite method is the most common. The phosphoramidite approach (Figure 10) allows for obtaining both natural DNA/RNA and plenty of modified analogs (phosphorothioates, phosphoroselenoathes, triesters and others). Its alternative is the H-phosphonate method (Figure 11) [40-42]. Particular advantage of this method is that it can be used in the synthesis without protection of nucleobases.\nDepending on its destination, the synthesis must be very carefully designed considering the strategy of group protection to make them stable under reaction conditions. a&nbsp;decision must be also made whether to use the phosphoramidite method or the H-phosphonate method taking also into account whether the product is to be immobilized on the support or not, which depends on expected results. \u00a0Keywords: oligonucleotide synthesis, phosphoramidite method, H-phosphonate method, supports, linkers.",

            "abstract": "Saliva is a&nbsp;gel resembling liquid, that acts almost as an organic tissue [1]. Saliva influences oral health through its non-specific physico-chemical properties [2]. It is composed of secretions from parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands, and smaller contributions come from minor salivary glands (e.g. palatal and labial). Saliva contains a&nbsp;number of proteins and polypeptides [2]. One of them is statherin a&nbsp;multifunctional 43-amino acid residue phosphominiprotein, containing vicinal phosphoserines at 2 and 3 positions and seven residues of tyrosine (Fig. 1) [7]. The relevant structural feature of statherin is N-terminal helix segment connected to a&nbsp;long poly--L-proline type II segment, which is followed by a&nbsp;short extended structure [14]. The gene for statherin is believed to be a&nbsp;single-copy gene and has been mapped to human chromosome 4q11-13 [20].\nThe statherin variants are SV1, SV2 and SV3 which comprise approx. 30% of the statherin family (Fig. 6). The ratios of statherin : SV1 and SV2 : SV3 are in both cases approx. 3 : 1. Statherin and SV2 are products of two different transcripts found in each of the major salivary gland. The variants SV1 and SV3 are derived by post-translational processing of statherin and SV2 [22].\nStatherin is a&nbsp;multifunctional molecule that shows a&nbsp;high affinity for calcium phosphate minerals such as hydroxyapatite. It takes part in the calcium and phosphate transport during secretion in the salivary glands, is responsible for the protection and recalcification of tooth enamel, promotes selective initial bacterial colonization of enamel, and functions as a&nbsp;boundary lubricant on the enamel surface [38, 39]. Satherin levels of concentration in saliva could be in relation with the precancerous and cancerous lesions of the oral cavity [38].\nThe understanding of a&nbsp;profile and role of statherin has become important in medicine as the peptide could play a&nbsp;protective effect in oral cavity. However, the role and the functions of this peptide are still not well-know [38]. \u00a0Keywords: saliva, salivary proteins, statherin, oral cavity.",

            "abstract": "The use of radiometal-labeled small complexes and biomolecules as diagnostic and therapeutic agents is a&nbsp;relatively new area of medical research. Radiopharmaceuticals are radiolabeled molecules designed to deliver ionizing radiation doses to specific disease sites. Between the targeting biomolecule and a&nbsp;radionuclide a&nbsp;bifunctional ligand is inserted, one end of which is covalently attached to the targeting molecule either directly or through a&nbsp;linker whereas the other strongly coordinates a&nbsp;metallic radionuclide. Selection of a&nbsp;bifunctional ligand is largely determined by the nature and oxidation state of a&nbsp;metal ion. The metal chelate can significantly affect the tumor uptake and biodistribution of radiopharmaceuticals based on small biomolecules. This is because in many cases the metal chelate contributes greatly to the overall size and lipophilicity of the radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, the design and selection of the ligand is very important for the development of a&nbsp;clinically useful therapeutic agent. The requirement for high thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the metal complex is often achieved through the use of macrocyclic ligands with a&nbsp;functionalized arm for covalent bonding to the biomolecule.\nIn this review synthesis of bifunctional macrocyclic ligands and properties of radionuclide macrocyclic complexes used in nuclear medicine are presented. We describe results in two areas: substituted macrocyclic aza ligands for chelation of hard metal cations, and macrocycles containing sulphur for complexation of soft metal cations. Special attention was paid to stability of the complexes as well as to their lipophilicity, which affect biological properties of the formed radiopharmaceuticals. We also include a&nbsp;forecast of the near-term opportunities that are likely to determine practice in the next few years. \u00a0Keywords: nuclear medicine, radiopharmacy, macrocyclic ligands.",

            "abstract": "As early as in 1961, it has been demonstrated that turnovers of individual enzyme molecules can be detected [1]. In the nineties, advances in single-molecule methods, in particular in confocal microscopy (Fig. 1), made it possible to monitor more closely enzymatic turnovers at a&nbsp;single-molecule level [2-5]. This led to the discoveries of static disorder and dynamic disorder, and closely related memory effects in enzymatic turnovers [6-8]. Differences in activity of individual molecules of the same enzyme are called static disorder. Time-dependent fluctuations of enzymatic activity are called dynamic disorder. One manifestation of dynamic disorder is the fact that consecutive enzymatic turnovers are not statistically independent, which is called \"memory effect\". It is believed that static dis-order and dynamic disorder are related to conformational dynamics of enzyme molecules.\nIn this review we discuss current issues of single-molecule enzymology, in particular kinetic effects that are specific to single-enzyme measurements. First we review the conceptual basis of single-enzyme kinetics and the initial work on single enzymes. We focus on the ping-pong mechanism of bisubstrate enzyme reactions (Eqs. (1) and (2)), and consider fluorescence trajectories (Figs. 2 and 3) associated with enzymatic turnovers. Two cases are distinguished. In the first, fluorescence comes from an enzyme molecule and fluorescence intensity jumps called blinking carry information on enzymatic activity. Jumps between a&nbsp;fluorescent (on) and non-fluorescent (off) states (Eqs. (4), (5), and Fig. 2) indicate the moments when the photophysical state of an enzyme changes during enzymatic turnovers. In the second case, fluorescence comes from product molecules whereas enzyme and substrate are non-fluorescent. Fluorescence bursts on a&nbsp;trajectory indicate the moments when non-fluorescent substrate molecules are converted into fluorescent product molecules that subsequently diffuse away from the detection volume (Eqs. (8), (9) and Fig. 3).\nIn Section 1 we present selected experiments implying the effect of conformational dynamics on enzymatic kinetics. In Section 1.1, we discuss cholesterol oxydase and dihydroorotate dihydrogenase as examples of enzymes whose on-off fluorescence blinking is caused by chemical reactions at the enzyme active site. In Section 1.2 we discuss \u03b2-lactosidase and lipase B as enzymes which turnovers can generate fluorescent products from suitably chosen non-fluorescent substrates.\nIn Section 2, we review modeling and simulations of single-enzyme data. The aim of data modeling is to gain insight into single-enzyme activity through analysis of models of increasing complexity. Phenomenological models attempt to capture the essence of single-enzyme kinetics without going into molecular details. If a&nbsp;model is simple enough it may allow analytical solutions. For instance, a&nbsp;simple model of on-off blinking is given in Scheme (25). This scheme is capable of reproducing memory effect that can be visualized by a&nbsp;two-dimensional histogram of consecutive on and off times (Figs. 5a and 5b).\nFinally, in the last section we present an outlook for single-molecule enzymology.",

            "abstract": "The natural ultramarine (lazurite, lapis lazuli) has been known and valued since the ancient times as semiprecious gem applied for jewelry, artistic works, decoration and painting. In Middle Ages it was used as excellent, but very expensive pigment. At the beginning of the nineteenth century a&nbsp;method of synthesis of artificial ultramarine has been discovered and it soon became a&nbsp;common inexpensive commercial product applied mostly for production of paints and as an optical brightener. The procedure included heating of the substrate mixtures (kaolin, sulfur, sodium carbonate, reducing agent) in kilns at high temperature (800\u00b0C). The technology of ultramarine production has not been substantially changed up to now, whereas the law regulations concerning environment protection imposed in the twentieth century could not accept a&nbsp;serious air pollution (SO2, H2S) always accompanying the production process. Therefore, searching for novel, environmentally friendly procedures becomes challenging.\nUltramarine is an aluminosilicate with sodalite structure that contains sulfur anion-radicals (mostly \u2022S3-) combined with Na+ cations embedded inside \u03b2-cages. The sulfur radicals play a&nbsp;role of chromophores (\u2022S3- blue, \u2022S3- yellow). Sodalite is a&nbsp;zeolite and the sodalite units (\u03b2-cages) are constituents of structure of several zeolites (LTA, FAU, LTN, EMT).\nThe use of zeolitic structures for encapsulation of sulfur anion radicals appeared very promising. The direct introduction of sulfur radicals from aprotic solutions of oligosulfides [27] was not successful but the thermal treatment of zeolites mixed with sulfur radical precursors (NaSn, S + alkalis) resulted in colored products analogous to ultramarine [24-26, 30, 31]. Zeolites a&nbsp;seem the most useful for preparation of sulfur pigments but other zeolites can be applied as well. The products of various colors (yellow, green blue and sometimes pinky) and shades can be obtained by choosing appropriate zeolite, radi-cal precursor, kind and content of alkaline cation in the initial mixture, temperature (400-800\u00b0C) and time of treatment. It was found that zeolite structure can be maintained upon the thermal treatment or it can be transformed (mostly towards SOD) under highly alkaline thermal treatment. The sulfur radicals can also be embedded inside smaller than \u03b2-cages (e.g. CAN) which favors a&nbsp;generation of smaller radicals (i.e. \u2022S2-) [39-42]. It is also possible to incorporate the sulfur compounds into zeolites during their crystallization and then a&nbsp;generation of radical upon heating. The sulfur pigments based on non aluminosilicate matrices (e.g. AlPO4-20) can be also obtained [38, 53].\nGenerally use of zeolites allows to obtain ultramarine-like pigments with broad range of colors under much milder than conventional conditions and with much lower emission of polluting agents. \u00a0Keywords: ultramarine, zeolites, molecular sieves, sulfur radicals, encapsulation.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysts play an important role in the manufacture of various chemical substances in large-scale processes, e.g. crude oil processing and organic synthesis [1]. Heterogeneous catalyst most often consists of a&nbsp;transition metal arranged on an oxide support [2]. The transition metal employed is usually one from Group 10 of the Periodic Table (Ni, Pd or Pt). The Group 10 metals are efficient catalysts of reactions with hydrogen. Such reactions occur in the above-mentioned crude oil processing and organic synthesis.\nIn large-scale applications some modifications of the catalyst properties are often necessary to increase the rate of an appropriate stage of catalyzed reaction and to avoid by-products. The change of the catalytic properties can be obtained by incorporating another metal into the catalyst. Heterogeneous catalysts in which the active part contains two metals are called bimetallic catalysts or, more generally, bimetallic systems [3, 4]. Research on bimetallic catalysts was initiated in the 1960s and since then these catalysts have become an object of increasingly in-depth investigations [5].\nThe aim of this review is to summarize the available knowledge on heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts. The review has been narrowed only to a&nbsp;few combinations of metals, i.e. Pd-Ag, Pd-Pt, Pd-Au, Pt-Ag, and Pt-Au.\nIn the first part of the review some general information on the forms of the bimetallic systems is presented. The term bimetallic system itself is quite broad and includes, among other, the following representatives (Fig. 1): alloys, surface alloys, monometallic monolayer or pseudomorphic overlayers arranged on the surface of the other metal, monometallic nanoparticles and clusters arranged on the surface of the other metal, alloyed nanoparticles and clusters, core/shell nanoparticles and clusters, and heteroaggregates. Recently, the last three of these representatives have been in the centre of interest [5, 6]. They offer properties very different from those characteristic of bulk materials [15].\nLater, the methods of synthesis and structural characterization of the bimetallic systems are described. At present, the preparation of the bimetallic catalysts that exhibit an appropriate structure is difficult and expensive. Hence, further progress in this field is still required. Some new methods of preparation [7, 16-41], as well as many experimental [42-45, 48-67] and theoretical papers [69-77] on structural, energetic and electronic properties of the bimetallic systems are reviewed.\nIn the last part of the review the catalytic behaviour of the Pd-Ag, Pd-Pt, Pd-Au, Pt-Ag and Pt-Au systems is discussed in detail. The discussion concentrates on the catalytic reactions with hydrogen, e.g. hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, etc. [106-137]. In such reactions the bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher selectivity than the monometallic ones. They also have better resistance to deactivation. At the very end of this review the theoretical investigations on H2 dissociation and H adsorption on the bimetallic systems have been mentioned [138-155]. \u00a0Keywords: heterogeneous catalysis, bimetallic catalyst, hydrogen.",

            "abstract": "In relation to a&nbsp;very limited scale of tolerance of organisms to different geometrical isomers it has been imperative to invent a&nbsp;method which would enable a&nbsp;precise and fast evaluation of a&nbsp;spatial structure of optically active compounds. Using a&nbsp;spectroscopic method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) proved to be an excellent solution. In order to define an absolute configuration by means of NMR, the enantiomeric mixture must be transformed into diastereoisomeric one by adding chiral auxiliary substituents.\nWe distinguish three types of chiral auxiliary reagents: CDAs (chiral derivatizing agents), CSAs (chiral solvating agents), CLSRs (chiral lanthanide shift reagents). Chiral derivatizing agents are the most frequently used in analyses. The condensation reaction of an auxiliary compound with enantiomer may be single or double derivatization.\nIn case of a&nbsp;double derivatization, 1H NMR spectra of two diastereoisomers obtained as a&nbsp;result of condensation of (R)- and (S)-CDAs with the substrates are compared. The changes in the chemical shifts of the substituents L1 (the most bulky substituent) and L2 (the least bulky substituent) asymmetric carbon of the substrate in the two derivatives (R)- and (S)-CDAs is defined as \u0394\u03b4RS. The \u0394\u03b4RS value is the difference between the chemical shift in the (R)-CDAs derivative (\u03b4(R)) and (S)-CDAs derivative (\u03b4(S)) for the substituents L1 (\u0394\u03b4RSL1) and L2 (\u0394\u03b4RSL2) (Figure 2).\nIn case of a&nbsp;single derivatization, the tested enantiomer is combined with only one enantiomer ((R)- or (S)-CDA). In the single derivatization \u0394\u03b4AR (\u0394\u03b4AR = \u03b4(A)-\u03b4(R)) is the difference in the chemical shifts of the substituents L1 and L2 of a&nbsp;derivative and a&nbsp;free substrate (Figure 3) [1].\nAmong these auxiliary reagents are MPA (methoxyphenylacetic acid), MTPA (methoxytrifluoromethylphenylacetic acid), 9-AMA (9-anthrylmethoxyacetic acid), BPG (boc-phenylglycine), 9-AHA (ethyl 2-(9-anthryl)-2-hydroxyacetate), PGME (phenylglycine methyl ester), and PGDA (phenylglycine dimethyl amide). These reagents are currently being used to determine the absolute configuration of primary alcohols (Figure 4), secondary alcohols (Figure 5), tertiary alcohols, diols [2-5], triols [6], primary amines (Figure 6, 7), secondary amines (Figure 8), and carboxylic acids (Figure 9).\nOther methods of determining absolute configuration such as HPLC-NMR or \"mix and shake\" method are currently investigated - HPLC-NMR method allows determining the absolute configuration of enantiomeric mixture as well as a&nbsp;pure enantiomer, the use of semipreparative column allows to precisely distinguish the obtained derivatives, which undergo the spectroscopic analysis (Figure 11) [1].\nThe \"mix and shake\" method allows determining the absolute configuration in a&nbsp;few minutes and without any additional separation methods. The derivative/s is/are prepared by simply mixing a&nbsp;solid matrix-bond auxiliary reagent with a&nbsp;chiral substrate and NMR spectra of the resulting derivatives are obtained without any further manipulation (Figure 12) [7].\nKeywords: absolute configuration, nuclear magnetic resonance, auxiliary reagent, single and double derivatization.",

            "abstract": "Communal management facilities like composting plants or landfills are found to be significant sources of air pollution in the environment. Air pollution is caused by chemical compounds that are naturally generated during biological decomposition of organic waste. Most of these substances belong to the volatile organic compounds (VOC). They can be classified into the groups: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, chlorinated hydrocarbons and sulphur and nitrogen containing compounds. Their emissions to the atmosphere cause serious environmental concerns like potential health hazards, global warming, ozone layer damage and finally unpleasant odours that are the most important nuisance to citizens living in the vicinity of communal management objects. In the recent years the growing public concern about living conditions and the state of environment has resulted in the development of new analytical approaches suitable for monitoring and examining the volatile organic compounds in the air.\nThis article provides a&nbsp;review of the most frequently employed gas chromatographic methods used for determination of air pollutants emitted from communal management facilities. Gas chromatographs equipped with various types of columns and detectors (FID, PID) and coupled with mass spectrometers (GC/MS), olfactory detection port (GC/ODP) remain nowadays the most widely used and very suitable devices to investigate the presence and concentration of landfill odorants in the air [1-3].\nIn the article the above-mentioned methods are summarized and discussed.\nThe sampling technique in the analysis of gases is often the crucial point of the whole procedure. The most popular techniques of sample preparation including dynamic and passive enrichment on sorbents, followed by thermal desorption or extraction, solid-phase microextraction (SPME) or the modern approaches like use of the flux chamber [4, 5] are also described.\nFinally, the review covers the topic of miniaturization of gas-chromatographic instruments. Micro gas chromatographs (\u03bcGC) and portable gas chromatographs provide the possibility of on-site analysis without the risk of sample contamination or destruction. They are easy to operate and work on-line, giving immediate results, which permit to monitor the level of pollution in the real time and follow the time evolution of landfill emissions [6].\nIn the Table 1 some examples of volatile organic compounds determination recently carried out in different places of the world are presented. \u00a0Keywords: communal management facilities, gas chromatography, air sampling, microchromatography, air pollution.",

            "abstract": "An efficient formation of carbon-carbon bonds belongs to one of the most important transformations in synthetic chemistry. The reaction is predominantly catalyzed by the late transition metals [1, 2]. Traditional methods that have been employed, to accomplish this transformation include Stille and Suzuki reactions. However, due to a&nbsp;number of drawbacks inherent to the substrates used in these reactions, organosilicon reagents have emerged as competitive alternatives (the facility of preparation and purification of silanes, their high stability, and low-molecular weight). Because of the low polarizability of the C-Si bond, the silicon function must undergo nucleophilic activation to induce migration of a&nbsp;transferable group onto the organopalladium species (transmetallation) [3-8]. The family of palladium-based catalysts, used in the desilylative coupling reaction (DC), tolerates the presence of the majority of functional groups.\nThe paper gives a&nbsp;review of literature focused on the application of desilylative coupling in sequential reactions published till the end of 2007. The activity of different catalytic systems based on palladium compounds in desilylative coupling reactions has been characterized. The influence of some substituents and activators on the reaction as well as their mechanisms has been presented [36, 41, 94-104]. It is remarkable, that the two entirely different mechanisms can be operative for both fluoride and fluoride-free silanolate couplings [104-110], and that both are highly efficient room temperature reactions.\nAlkenylsilanes, used in sequential reactions, can be efficiently prepared by several stereo- and regioselective methodologies involving classical stoichiometric routes from organometallic reagents and, more recently, transition-metal-catalyzed transformations of alkynes and silylalkynes (via the hydrosilylation, Sonogashira reaction), alkenes (the dehydrogenative silylation [10, 12, 13], cross-metathesis [9-11], Heck reaction), and other silicon derivatives.\nMoreover, the paper provides a&nbsp;characterization of the desilylative coupling reaction (DC) conditions. Several independent sequential reactions (one-pot, tandem reaction), e.g. RCM/DC, Stille/DC, Heck/DC, Sonogashira/DC, cross-metathesis/DC, silylative coupling/DC etc., and their applications to the synthesis of biologically active compounds have been presented. The paper is completed with a&nbsp;list of the most important, in the author's opinion, monographs and review works on the application of the desilylative coupling catalysed by palladium compounds in organic synthesis. \u00a0Keywords: desilylative coupling, sequential reactions, palladium catalysts, organic synthesis",

From among the available range of sorption products, of the greatest importance are adsorbents obtained from coal, in particular active carbons.\nThe growing use of active carbons is a&nbsp;consequence of the readily available resources, their high mechanical and chemical resistance and easy degradability. Certain applications of active carbon require high adsorption capacity or high selectivity, therefore, many attempts have been undertaken to obtain sorbents showing well-developed surface area and enhanced sorption capacity towards certain adsorbates.

            "abstract": "This work describes the polymerization processes with electron-transfer reagents. Alkali metals, salts of aromatic hydrocarbons radical anions, and solutions of alkalides, i.e. salts containing alkali metal anions and complexed alkali metal cations, belong to such species [33-39].\nThe alkali metals transfer one electron to vinyl and diene monomers in the heterogeneous systems [54-73]. The radical anions are also able to transfer one electron [74, 77-82], however, in some cases they behave as nucleophiles [82-85] or bases [86]. These initiators are applied for the polymerization of vinyl and oxacyclic monomers in homogeneous systems. Both of them are named single-electron-transfer (SET) reagents.\nThe alkalides are two-electron-transfer (TET) reagents. Among them potassium potassides K-, K+(18-crown-6) and K-, K+(15-crown-5)2 in tetrahydrofuran solution are mostly used for the polymerization of various monomers [53]. The initiation with these salts is usually a&nbsp;multistage process. An organopotassium compound is formed as the intermediate product which after the protonation by crown ether becomes the real initiator of the polymerization of vinyl monomers [92, 93, 97, 100]. The organometallic intermediate can be also protonated by the monomer or can decompose with the elimination in the systems containing oxiranes [107, 110-113] or lactones [127]. Potassium alkoxides or potassium salts of carboxylic acids, respectively, are the genuine initiators in this case.\nCrown ethers, known as the stable activators of chemical reactions, can participate in these processes as the reagents [107, 110, 116]. In the ring-opening reaction they form unsaturated potassium alkoxides which serve as the additional initiating agents [53, 97]. \u00a0Keywords: electron-transfer, alkali metals, radical anions, alkalides, anionic polymerization, diene and vinyl monomers, oxiranes, lactones",

Ready availability of monomers from inexpensive, renewable resources and the fact that resulted materials do not degrade the environment are an additional asset.\nBiodegradable polymers for the biomedical applications are preferably obtained using initiators containing non-toxic metals, and aryloxides of metals such as magnesium are especially interesting in this context.\nDespite the high utility limited number of magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides reported in the literature have a&nbsp;well-defined structure proved by X-ray analysis, which is required to design \"single-site\" catalysts. However, it is possible to identify and characterise certain types of frameworks.\nHomoleptic magnesium bis-aryloxides depending on synthesis procedures and ligand structure can crystallise as monomers [12, 40, 44], dimers [47, 48], trimers [47, 48] and tetramers [47, 48] with the coordination number ranging from three to six. Among them candidates of primary importance for the application in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic esters are monomeric compounds. Up to now, however, only few examples of such species displaying the certain activity in living polymerization have been published [60-63]. Extremely important are homoleptic compounds able to act as initiators for ROP in presence of exterior alcohols which form end-groups in the resulting polymer [12, 50]. This constitutes a&nbsp;chance for the polymer chain modyfication achieved by simple introduction of functional groups and enable to obtain new drug-polymer complex. \u00a0Keywords: magnesium, arylokso complexes, initiators, lactide polymerization",

            "abstract": "Garlic (Allium sativum) has historically been one of the most common vegetables to serve as a&nbsp;both spice and medical herb in many countries.\nOne of the outstanding features of the chemical composition of garlic is the large amount of unique organosulfur compounds, which provide its characteristic flavor and odor and most of its potent biological activity. Two classes of primary organosulfur compounds are found in whole garlic cloves: \u03b3-glutamyl-S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteines and S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides (alliin, metiin, propiin, isallin) (Fig. 1, 2) [5-15]. When garlic is crushed or cut, S-alk(en)yl--L-cysteine sulfoxides are exposed to the enzyme alliinase and thiosulfinates, via intermediate sulfenic acids are formed (Fig. 6) [29-33]. The major thiosulfinate, allicin is a&nbsp;reactive intermediate species that can be transformed, into a&nbsp;variety of compounds including diallyl, methyl allyl and mono- di-, tri-, tetrasulfides, vinyldithiins and ajoenes (Fig. 7-9) [37-49]. Garlic belongs to the Allium species, which accumulate only fructans as their nonstructural carbohydrates [52-59]. Garlic is also known for its production of some unique furostanol saponins, e.g. proto-eruboside-B and sativoside-B1 (Fig. 10-12) [60-63]. The Allium species also contain high levels of flavonides, including apigenin, myricetin and quercetin (Fig. 13) [64, 65], moderate levels of vitamins as well as free amino acids (Arg, Gln, Asn, Glu, and Lys) [66-69]. It was found that the amino acid fraction of Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) contain Maillard reaction products, N-fructosyl glutamine (Fru-Glu), N\u03b1-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-arginine (Fru-Arg) (Fig. 14, 15) [74-76], as well as tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline derivatives (Fig. 16, 17) [77-82]. Recently, allixin (Fig. 18), a&nbsp;novel phytoalexin, with the structure 4H-pyran-4-one, as a&nbsp;novel substance with neurotrophic activity has been reported to by synthesized by garlic [83-85]. Garlic has the ability to accumulate the selenium from soil and the major selenium compound in both Se-enriched and unenriched garlic was identified as \u03b3-glutamyl-Se-methyl selenocysteine along with lesser amounts of Se-methyl selenocysteine, selenocysteine, selenomethionine among other compounds (Fig. 19) [86-96].\nPharmacological investigations have shown that garlic has a&nbsp;wide spectrum of actions, not only it is antimicrobial [97], but it also has beneficial effects in regard to cardiovascular and cancer diseases [2, 3, 14, 42]. a&nbsp;number of organosulfur substances derived from garlic such as allicin, allicin-derived organosulfur compounds including sulfides, ajoene, steroidal saponins, flavonides, Fru-Arg, Fru-Glu, organic seleno-compounds and tetrahydro-\u03b2-carboline derivatives have been found to have strong antioxidant properties. It has been suggested that garlic can prevent cardiovascular disease, inhibit platelet aggregation, decrease the synthesis of cholesterol and prevent cancer. Thus it may either prevent or delay chronic diseases associated with aging. \u00a0Keywords: garlic; \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine, cysteine sulfoxides, allin, alliinase, thiosulfinates, allicin; sulfides, ajoene, dithiins, fructans, saponins, organic seleno-compounds, carboline derivatives, allixin, antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardiovascular, anticancer activity",

            "abstract": "Bridged polysilsesquioxanes (BPs) are an emerging group of organic-inorganic hybrid materials where organic moieties are built into a&nbsp;siloxane matrix by stable covalent carbon-silicon bonds [1, 2]. The simplest precursors of BP xerogels can be presented as bis(trialkoxysilanes) structures M-(SiX3)n, where X is the hydrolyzable group, and M denotes the organic bridge (spacer). By means of the appropriate precursors in the reaction of hydrolytic polycondensation it is possible to design on a&nbsp;molecular level the considered materials keeping control over their characteristics.\nBridges can have a&nbsp;different nature, e.g. they can be representative of homologue series of saturated hydrocarbons or aromatic hydrocarbons. In fact, one of the greatest advantages is a&nbsp;huge range of sol-gel processable monomers with different organic bridges. As they can vary in composition, length, geometry of substitution and rigidity it makes possible to affect the chemical and physical properties of final materials, including structure-adsorption properties by the choice of the precursor. Flexibility of an organic bridge plays a&nbsp;key role in such a&nbsp;behavior: materials with long elastic bridges are more susceptible to collapsing during the last stages of the sol-gel treatment (ageing and drying). Furthermore, at the same length of an organic bridge, formation of mesoporosity materials is observed in the alkaline medium, while in the acid medium - formation of microporosity. The influence of factors such as flexibility of the bridge, monomer concentration, type of catalyst, ageing time, etc. on textural characteristics of BPs materials has been widely described in the literature [1-8] and is also shortly discussed in this article.\nAs the formation of these solids is kinetically controlled all parameters of a&nbsp;synthesis are able to influence the kinetics of the sol-gel process, what in result affects both the physical and chemical properties of the final materials (19, 20, 24-29). Thus, porosity, specific surface area, pore volume or surface chemistry can be tuned during sol-gel processing by a&nbsp;proper choice of monomers and synthesis conditions. Some illuminative examples of influencing the structure-adsorption characteristics has been discussed here.\nThe possibility of tailoring of the above-mentioned final properties makes bridged polysilsesquioxanes potential candidates in adsorption application. Up to date several works have been published in the literature describing such attempts. In this paper we briefly discuss the synthetic strategy, creation of porosity and some examples of the usage of BPs as adsorbents. Several research groups have been using these materials with different bridges (see Figure 10) to adsorb different metal ions such as Ag(I), Hg(II), Au(III), Pt(IV), Pd(II) and Rh(III) [68], Co(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Mo(VI) and U(VI) [7, 69], La, Ce, Pr, Nd(III), Pm, Sm(III), Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er(III), Tm(III), Yb, Lu [70], V(VI), Mo(VI), W(VI), Th(IV) and U(VI) [71]. Ethylene- and phenylene-bridged xerogels prepared via a&nbsp;surfactant template approach have been used as sorbents of phenols from solution [75]. Ethylene- and phenylene-bridged polysilsesquioxanes functionalized with amino and thiol groups have been successfully tested as adsorbents of volatile organic compounds such as: hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, and triethyloamine from the gas phase [76].\nExamples shown in the article testify to a&nbsp;great potential of these group of hybrid materials as sorbents. BPs can partially fill the gap caused by a&nbsp;limited use of other type of sorbents due to their complex production technology, low chemical and mechanical stability, low efficiency or selectivity. Two significant advantages should be mentioned here. First is the possibility of a&nbsp;homogenic distribution of organic moieties accessible to the adsorbate particles. It allows the creation of adsorption sites which force selectivity of the adsorption process by promoting a&nbsp;particular type of adsorption force, for example donor-acceptor or \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Secondly, the precise control of parameters such like the specific surface area or pore diameter induces adsorbents with predetermined characteristics. Such simultaneous control over the porosity and surface chemistry is a&nbsp;great advantage of bridged polysilsesquioxane materials.\nKeywords: hybrid materials, bridged polysilsesquioxanes, adsorbents, adsorption, porosity, sol-gel, functionalization.",

The performance of the explosives that came into use at that time and which are still commonly used (nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene) is three times higher than that of black powder. Within the next 150-year evolutionary development of explosives, their performance has been increased by about 60%. During that period, useful explosives were searched among organic compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. The search was quite successful. For example stable caged nitroamines (HNIW, Fig. 3) were synthesized which densities are higher than 2 g/cm3 and detonation velocity exceeds 10 km/s. Recently, potential candidates for high energy density materials (HEDM) have been observed among meta-stable compounds (e.g. all-nitrogen compounds), molecular composites where fuel and oxidizer are mixed at a&nbsp;molecular level or nano-systems of reactive materials. It is assessed that in this way useful explosives can be produced with performance even ten times higher than that of HMX - the best explosive that is in use today. Such an increase in energy content would make possible miniaturization of ammunition and the fire power of small arms would become comparable to the contemporary artillery.

Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4), a&nbsp;natural product isolated from the South African bush willow tree Combretum caffrum, binds to the colchicine binding site and inhibits the polymerization of microtubules. CA-4 exhibits potent cytotoxicity against a&nbsp;variety of human cancer cell lines including multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines [5-7]. The studies of structure-activity relationship (SAR) of CA-4 1 (Fig. 1) showed that 3,4,5-trimethoxy substitution on the a&nbsp;ring and the 4'-methoxy group on the B ring and the cis-olefin configuration are crucial for potent cytotoxicity, while the 3'-hydroxy group is optional [5-7]. a&nbsp;many of CA-4 analogues were synthesized where the double bond have been replaced by introduction of nonheterocyclic groups (e.g. ethers, olefins, ketones, sulfonates, sulfonamides, amide derivatives, amine, cyclopentanes) or heterocyclic groups containing five-membered rings (e.g. pyrazoles, thiazoles, triazoles, tetrazoles, oxazoles, furans, dioxolanes, thiophenes) and indoles [5, 7, 41, 56] (Fig. 9-12). Up to now, many CA-4 analogues and their biological activity have been extensively studied and three derivatives are currently in clinical trials: a&nbsp;water-soluble disodium phosphate derivative of CA-4 (CA-4P) 11c (Fig. 3); Oxi-4503, a&nbsp;water-soluble combretastatin A-1 (CA-1diP) 4a (Fig. 1); and AC7700 59e (Scheme 7) an aminocombretastatin prodrug developed in Japan in 1998 [5-10, 34]. \u00a0 Keywords: inhibitors of microtubule, combretastatin A-4, CA-4, synthesis, CA-4 analogues, antitumor activity, antimitotic activity.",

Such radiopharmaceutics as 18F-FMISO, 123I-IAZA, 99m Tc-HL-91 (Fig. 1b, 3b, 7b) are used in the state-of-the art scintigraphic and tomographic techniques, i.e. in the PET and SPECT methods to determine carcinoma progression and detect cells in hipoxic state already at the early stage of carcinoma development [2, 3]. These noninvasive and selective for hipoxic cells methods are characterized by excellent sensitivity and do not exert noxious effect on the remaining cells of the human organism [4, 5]. Characteristic hipoxia of solid tumors can be also identified with invasive methods, e.g. Elisa test or measurement of oxygen concentration in pathological cells using a&nbsp;microprobe. However, medical interference in the tissues affects the condition of the whole organism. Technical complications and low accuracy resulting from non-uniform hipoxia of the cancerous tissue environment render rear usage of these methods in clinical practice [3]. Diagnosis of hipoxia occurring in the carcinoma-changed cells permits treatment with drugs possessing bioreductive mechanism of activity. In this group of drugs, apart from nitro compounds and chinon derivatives, we can distinguish compounds with N-oxide structure [25]. Tripazamine (Fig. 11b) and banoxantrone (Fig. 11a) represent the latter group of compounds. These are so far the drugs with the best therapeutic parameters expressed by selectivity, efficiency of action and low general toxicity [25]. Also, gene therapy with the use of adenovirus vector coding nitroreductase seems to be a&nbsp;promising mode of treatment. This enzyme induces cytotoxic activity of nitro compounds, e.g. CB1954 (Fig. 10c), for cancerous cells with hypoxia [26].\u00a0 Keywords: radiopharmaceutics, hipoxia, antitumor drugs.",

            "abstract": "Recently major advances have been made in the development of oligonucleotides as potential therapeutic agents [1-3]. However, a&nbsp;frequent limitation of their use is poor cellular uptake [5]. Among the many molecules that have been reported to enhance cell delivery of oligonucleotides there is a&nbsp;number of peptide carriers. They are preferably linked by covalent bond in many possible ways, resulting in a&nbsp;new class of compounds known as peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) [6a, 9]. a&nbsp;variety of chemical linkages have been used to link the peptide and oligonucleotide fragments. a&nbsp;peptide can be conjugated either at the base-, 3'-, or 5'-position of the sugar unit or at the backbone of the oligonucleotide [10]. Similarly, the point of conjugation in a&nbsp;peptide can be either the C- or N-terminus or the side chain.\nTwo different strategies have been adopted for the synthesis of POCs: in-line solid-phase synthesis (divergent method) and fragment conjugation (convergent method) [11].\nIn divergent method, the peptide and oligonucleotide fragments are assembled on automatic synthesizers, sequentially on the same solid support, until the final step. In predominant cases, the peptides are assembled first by the Fmoc method, while the oligonucleotides are assembled next using the phosphoramidite method [12]. In-line synthesis could be most direct for preparing POCs, but finding the right combination of protecting groups is the key problem. The first step in preparation of POCs involves modification of solid supports with suitable linkers [10]. a&nbsp;number of monofunctionalized as well as bifunctionalized linkers were immobilized over solid supports through suitable spacers (Figure 1).\nIn the fragment conjugation, the peptide and oligonucleotide fragments are synthesized individually, cleaved from their solid supports, deprotected and purified, separately. Therefore, the most appropriate synthetic chemistry can be used for each component without concern for incompatibility. Both biopolimers are finally linked postsynthetically utilizing the reactive functional groups which are attached at the desired site of conjugation (Figure 4) [5]. If the postsynthetic conjugation is performed with one of the oligomers still joined to the solid phase, it is called the solid-phase fragment conjugation method. Alternatively, if the conjugation is effected after complete isolation and purification of the peptides and oligonucleotides, it is called fragment conjugation in the liquid phase [10].\nBesides their potential use for therapeutic applications, POCs can serve as research tools, for example, as fluorescent probes [44] or PCR primers [25, 45]. With increased specificity and strength of target binding, POCs may be useful in diagnostic applications or as affinity purification reagents.\u00a0 Keywords: peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs), in-line solid-phase synthesis, fragment conjugation, linkers, protecting groups, antisense strategy, therapeutic applications.",

            "abstract": "The important role of palladium nanoparticles has been recently demonstrated in many catalytic systems designed for C-C bond forming reactions [1-4]. There are examples of catalytic systems described earlier as homogeneous in which Pd(0) nanoparticles were now identified. In the article three different palladium catalytic systems are discussed. In the first one, Pd(0) nanoparticles, obtained by chemical reduction of PdCl2 and stabilized by polyvinylpyrrolidone, were used for Heck coupling in [Bu4N]Br medium. Decrease of nanoparticles size in reaction conditions was explained as a&nbsp;result of dissolution of Pd(0) colloid and simultaneous formation of catalytically active monomolecular anionic palladium complexes [33]. The second example presents application of Pd(II) and Pd(0) supported on alumina-based oxides in Suzuki-Miyaura reaction [36]. Reduction of Pd(II) to Pd(0) nanoparticles under reaction conditions was confirmed. In contrast to the first described case, in Suzuki-Miyaura reaction the size of Pd(0) nanoparticles was the same before and after the catalytic cycle. The catalytic activity of both palladium forms was quite high, however Pd(0) formed in situ was slightly more efficient as catalyst. In the third part of the article studies of palladium reduction in anionic complexes of [IL]2[PdX4] type are shown, where IL = imidazolium cation [37]. These complexes catalyzed well Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, but they were not stable under reaction conditions and decomposed to Pd(0) nanoparticles and Pd black. Using ESI-MS method it was possible to identify polynuclear (Pd3, Pd5) intermediate forms, stabilized with imidazolium cations or N-heterocyclic carbenes. In all systems discussed in the article co-existence of Pd(0) nanoparticles and monomolecular complexes was observed. That is important for understanding of the nature of catalytically active forms in C-C bond forming reactions.\u00a0 Keywords: C-C bond forming reactions, Heck reaction, Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, Pd(0) nanoparticles, palladium colloid, N-heterocyclic carbene",

            "abstract": "In the last decades, free radicals have been discussed to play a&nbsp;key role in the pathology of several diseases, such as cancer, artheriosclerosis or inflammatory diseases [1, 2]. Numerous dietary antioxidants, e.g. vitamin C, phenolic and polyphenolic compounds as well as carotenoides are considered as effective agents in prevention of these diseases [4]. The chemical diversity of antioxidants occurring in food makes it difficult to separate individual antioxidant compounds from the animal or vegetable matrix and quantify them. Antioxidant activity is widely used as a&nbsp;parameter to characterize the redox status of different biological or dietary samples. Many analytical methods for determining of total antioxidant activity (TAA) have been proposed in the literature of the last decade.\nThe present review deals with the methods involving electron-transfer reactions with chromogen compounds: the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) [6-29], the DPPH assay [31-41], the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay [42-48], the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay [49-55], and the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) method [56]. These assays enable to measure the activity of an antioxidant through the reduction of an oxidizing agent, which changes colour during the redox reaction. The degree of colour change corresponds to the concentration of antioxidant in the sample. The main purpose of this review is to describe and discuss the chemical fundamentals of these methods. The applications of voltammetry and other electroanalytical methods were also demonstrated [58-71]. In addition, properties and the use of reference compounds in the antioxidant activity assessment was considered [72-85].\nThe summary contains conclusions on the scope of application, the most important advantages and shortcomings of the methods described [50, 86-88].\u00a0 Keywords: antioxidants; free radicals; total antioxidant capacity",

Allelochemicals can be released into the environment and despite what effect they evoke towards living organisms this kind of specific chemical interactions is known as \"allelopathy\".\nAllelopathic phenomena have been observed and studied from ancient times. Theophrastus from Eresos, a&nbsp;disciple of Aristotle, reported an inhibitory effect of pigweed Polygonum spp. on alfalfa in ca. 350 B.C., whereas Pliny described the harmful effects of several plants on cropland in ca. 1 A.D. [2-5]. Although chemical interactions between plants have been known for thousands years, the term allelopathy was used for the first time in 1937 [5]. It derives from Latin words allelon (\"of each other\") and pathos (\"to suffer\") and refers to the chemical interactions among species. In recent years there has been an increasing interest towards the perspective of exploiting allelopathy and allelochemicals as an alternative strategy for controlling weeds in particular, but also for controlling insects and plant diseases.\nPlants produce a&nbsp;wide variety of secondary metabolites that play important roles in ecological interactions. This is one, probably the most pronounced, of a&nbsp;variety of ways in which certain plants can protect themselves against competition, infection or feeding in their natural habitats. Some of secondary metabolites may also play an important role in chemical mediation of growth and development of plant communities. These substances are called \"allelochemicals\" and are relea-sed into the environment in order to interfere with the growth of competing plants or act as chemical defence against pathogens and animals. Therefore such compounds might be considered as constituents of plant defence system and could be treated as a&nbsp;kind of chemical weapons. Originally, compounds like allelochemicals were thought to occur exclusively in higher plants. Ongoing research, however, has revealed them also to be synthesized by bacteria, lower plants and fungi.\nAllelochemicals may furnish an entirely new generation of naturally produced weed-controlling compounds, replacing synthetic herbicides and other pesticides with non-acumulatting easy-degradable substances.

This arises a&nbsp;question about availability of stereoregular, P-defined analogues of DNA and RNA.\nShort synthetic oligonucleotides are indispensable tools in biomolecular and structural studies [5,\u00a06].

[34] found that for therapeutic applications, only chimeric oligonucleotides 16 with incorporated RP-dinucleoside methanephosphonates had acceptable binding affinity towards complementary template of DNA and RNA. Isosequential chimeric oligomers, constructed either from diastereomeric mixtures of dinucleoside methanephosphonates, or from those with SP-configuration, form less stable duplexes with the same complementary RNA templates. The preparation of the aforementioned chimeras utilized a&nbsp;\"dimeric building blocks\" approach [23]. The corresponding dinucleoside (3',5')-methanephosphonates 17 were separated into diastereomers by chromatographic methods. After removal of the 3'-O-protecting group, the required RP-isomers were activated at the 3'-O-position, and used as such for condensation via the phosphoramidite method [25]. Attempts towards their P-epimerization and recycling have failed. Such situation was notwithstanding the requirement of a&nbsp;cost-effective synthesis of new potential therapeutics. Therefore, Stec et al. [36-38], and efforts were undertaken in the design of a&nbsp;cost-effective synthesis of RP-dinucleoside (3',5')-methanephosphonates 17.

Over the last 20 years a&nbsp;wide range of medicinal aspects of various compounds of vanadium have been investigated and documented [10-21]. Vanadium displays relevant biological actions such as insulin-mimicking or spermicidal [5-7] as well as it shows antitumor activity [3, 4]. This review has focused on vanadium inorganic compounds and organic complexes which have insulin-mimetic and anti-diabetic properties. Vanadium-based therapeutic agents belong to the class of compounds in which active is the metal ion and the ligand plays only an ancillary role - delivers active metal to target tissues what may have important implications for the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties of vanadium.\nVanadium salts such as oxovanadium(IV) sulphate (vanadyl sulphate) VOSO4 or sodium orthovanadate(V) NaVO3 and some vanadium organic complexes are potent insulin-mimetic compounds for treating both type i&nbsp;and type II in animal model, cell culture systems and human diabetes. Many studies have demonstrated that the oral administration of vanadium compounds normalizes blood glucose levels, stimulates glucose intake into cells and causes inhibition of glikoneogenesis and lypolysis. Vanadyl sulphate and other simple salts are effective but unfortunately have poor uptake through gastrointestinal system and have some toxic effects. Complexation with organic ligands may improve vanadium efficacy and decrease toxic side effects. Since 1990 several vanadium compounds (vanadyl, vanadate and peroxovanadate) with organic ligands have been proposed for this purpose. This review describes vanadyl complexes with ligand such as maltol and its derivatives, picolinate ion, flavonoids, sulphur containing compounds and hypoglycemic drugs (metformine and thiazolidenodiones). In recent years some VO(IV) complexes with maltol - bis(maltolato)oxovanadium (BMOV) and ethylmaltol (BEOV) have been proposed for clinical use in humans. BEOV has in 2000 completed I-st phase of human clinical trials. To asses the insulinomimetic and anti-diabetic activities of vanadium(IV) complexes several in vitro- and in vivo systems have been performed. Hypoglycemic and glucose normalizing activity were investigated in vivo in both type i&nbsp;and II diabetic animal (mice and rats) models. In vitro insulinomimetic activity was examined in isolated rat adipocytes.\nAlternatively for improving bioavailability and anti-diabetic efficacy of vanadium several novel drug delivery systems such as chitosan-hydrogel or enteric-coated capluses containing vanadium [55, 56, 60] compounds have been tested.

            "abstract": "Witnessed within the last decades rapid development of the chemistry of Group 4 metals can be ascribed to the interesting structural properties of such complexes, as well as to wide range of their industrial applications. Species of titanium and zirconium bonded to aryloxo ligands are very good fodder for asymmetric organic syntheses, are very often used as base compounds for material engineering and catalysts or initiators for different kind of polymerization processes, and also for production of biodegradable materials. a&nbsp;carefully chosen ligand plays a&nbsp;crucial role in construction of potential candidates for these applications.\nAryloxides form a&nbsp;big family of mono-, bis- and poliaryloxo ligands. They are very versatile since their structure and electronic properties are easily modified by changing of ring substitution patterns [10, 11], introducing of O, S, NR, Se, Te heterogroups [21] between aromatic rings [12-14], changing their numbers [15, 16] or even linking them by carbon chains [17, 18]. All those modifications can influence the structure and catalytic activity of formed complexes.\nApart from aryloxides, also amino- and iminoaryloxides form the second group of ligands successfully utilized in chemistry of Group 4 metals. Chemical properties of these ligands can be easily modified through changing aromatic rings by using substituents influencing electronic properties and steric demands. For example, nitrogen atom changed by introduction of a&nbsp;group containing additional centre of coordination results in obtaining tridendate ligand [43]. Mannich condensation is the main synthetic method for obtaining these compounds [47]. Usage of primary, secondary or tertiary amine, as well as a&nbsp;change in reaction stechiometry or even a&nbsp;condition can lead to amine-aryloxide, amine-bisaryloxide or benzoxazine.\nSyntheses of transition metal compounds with aryloxide or amine/iminearyloxide species are generated by direct ligand reaction with a&nbsp;metal precursors MRn, M(OR)n, M(NR2)n, MCln (R = alkyl).\nMonodendate aryloxo ligands have a&nbsp;tendency to form \u03bc-bridges between metal centres, which result in formation of oligomeric compound [M(OAr)n]m. Reactions of bisaryloxo ligands H2(LEtBu,Me) (E = -, CH2, C2H4) with chosen titanium and zirconium precursors produce heteroleptic, monomeric and tetrahedral complexes [12, 19, 20]. Change of a&nbsp;bridging group between phenyl rings to C2H4 increases the size of chelating ring in formed complexes [MX2(LC2H4tBu,Me)] [20, 35, 36] and at the same time decreases the inversion barrier which is the reason for relatively easy conformation changes in solutions.\nImine-aryloxide complexes of Group 4 metals have been known since 1960 [44], but mainly in last decade we can witness the rapid development of this group. Here, one of the most interesting species are complexes with tetradendate amino-bisaryloxo ligands. These compound can adapt a&nbsp;different symmetry which depends on a&nbsp;ligand structure, with additional electron pair donor D [10].\nFirst literature reports on the use of titanium complexes in polymerization of cyclic esters are from 1958 [61]. Mono-, and bisaryloxide complexes were reported to act as initiators for that reaction but the highest activity was obtained when heteroleptic titanium compounds supported by tridendate ligand (H2LN-R'tBu) [48] were used.\nCatalytic activity in lactide polymerization on titanium and zirconium complexes strongly depends on metal and aromatic rings substituents .\nTransition metal complexes of Group 4 metals stabilized by aryloxo and imine/aminearyloxo ligands play a&nbsp;very important role among relatively new non-metalocene catalysts for olefin polymerization. Monoaryloxide complexes are not effective in that process [66], titanium and zirconium species with bisaryloxo ligands, in which aromatic rings are linked by CH2 are less effective in ethene [68, 69] polymerization when compared to cyclopentadienyls [70].\nZirconium and hafnium amine-bisaryloxides are highly effective in 1-hexene polymerization and structure of a&nbsp;ligand plays here a&nbsp;key role [15]. Additional donor of electron density is also an important factor influencing molecular mass and polymer tacticity. Imine-aryloxide species with bulky groups in ortho- or NO2, OMe in para- positions are highly effective in polyethylene production.\nIn asymmetric syntheses titanium and zirconium species are used for different processes, for example enantioselective oxidation, reduction, nucleophilic addition, cycloaddition and many others [81-84].

Many of them are biologically active compounds, natural products, drugs, synthetic materials and practically useful chemicals [1-5]. Therefore, organic chemists have been making extensive efforts to produce these heterocyclic compounds by developing new and efficient synthetic transformations.\nAmong a&nbsp;variety of new synthetic transformations, transition-metal-catalyzed reactions are very attractive methodologies for synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, since they permit to construct complicated molecules directly from readily accessible starting materials under mild conditions. For this purpose palladium is one of the most widely used transition metals mainly due to the mild reaction conditions used, high yields, a&nbsp;tolerance of a&nbsp;large variety of functional groups, and high regio-, stereo- and enantioselectivity observed [6].\nPd0-catalyzed allylic alkylations and PdII-catalyzed oxidative cyclization of hydroksy(amino)alkene(alkyne)nucleophiles in the intermolecular mode have been particularly notable in this area due to their ability to elicit control in the aforementioned areas, often under very mild conditions.\nPd0-catalyzed intra- or intermolecular heteroannulation through allylic alkylation, the so-called Tsuji-Trost reaction, generally employs allylic acetates [9-14], carbonates [15-29] or vinyl epoxides [30-34] bearing a&nbsp;hydroxy or an amino group as the substrates. Allylsilanes have also been used as precursors of the \u03b73-allyl intermediates, starting from PdCl2 and CuCl2, affording the corresponding THF and THP derivatives in quite good yields [38-40].\nThe PdII-catalyzed cyclization of alkenyl alcohols has led to cyclic enols by \u03b2-hydride elimination, or to oxygen heterocycles bearing a&nbsp;vinyl group through a&nbsp;\u03b2-hydroxy elimination, if the alkenol possesses an allyl alcohol moiety. Using this methodology a&nbsp;large variety of oxygen- or nitrogen-containing heterocycles have been obtained even in an asymmetric fashion [51-95].

In the presented paper, the recent achievements in heterogeneous oxidation of benzene to phenol and propene to propylene oxide, as well as an oxidative functionalization of light paraffins have been demonstrated. The successful use of molecular sieves modified with transition metal cations as catalysts for oxidation reactions, performed in the presence of nitrous oxide as an oxidant has been shown.\nOne-stage benzene to phenol hydroxylation was developed and commercialised on the base of iron modified high silica zeolites as catalysts and N2O as an oxidant. However, structure of the active iron complex and mechanism of the oxidation reaction are still under debate. The most important ideas are presented in the paper.\nPanov and co-workers [5, 10, 29] underline the role of binuclear iron complex accommodated on ion-exchangeable centres in zeolite channels which easily undergo autoreducion at high temperature and subsequent reoxidation as a&nbsp;result of contact with N2O. Ryder and Bell [35, 36] indicate (FeO2)+ complex as responsible for benzene hydroxylation, while Hensen and co-workers [37, 38] claim, that not only iron but also aluminium cation is involved in active centre leading to formation of Fe-O-Al complex.\nOxidation of light paraffins over N2O/Fe-ZSM-5 system results in oxydehydrogenation of alkanes and formation of olefins [68, 72, 80]. The possible mechanisms of N2O decomposition in the presence of alkanes and ODH products, developed in the literature [58, 80-82], are presented.\nPropylene epoxidation, performed over transition metal cations (iron, vanadium and mixed system) modified molecular sieves, is also presented.

Three properties which are useful in characterizing the nature of PSA are tack (initial adhesion), peel adhesion (adhesion) and shear strength (cohesion). Scientific interest in UV-curable system developed in the 1940s, when the first patent was granted for unsaturated polyester styrene inks that polymerize readily under UV exposure [2]. Ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking technology is well established in the market and allows the manufacturing of a&nbsp;wide range of various photoreactive UV-cross-linkable pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA). Industrial applications of UV cross-linkable acrylic PSA have grown tremendously over the last 10 years. The balance between adhesive and cohesive strengths within the cross-linked layers is very important for the performance of UV-cross-linkable PSA. Dual cross-linking (UV and thermal) enables manufacturing of acrylic PSA layers with different adhesion-cohesion properties and offers opportunities to develop novel products in form of self-adhesive tapes with innovative features. UV radiation is used to induce cross-linking of the photoreactive acrylic PSA formulations containing suitable prepolymers, oligomers, unsaturated multifunctional monomers and conventional or unsaturated photoinitiators. Discussed herein is a&nbsp;new generation of photoreactive acrylic PSA that uses this dual (UV and thermal) cross-linking system. These dual cross-linkable acrylic PSA containing incorporated photoreactivity and thermal reactive cross--linking agents are characterized by excellent adhesive and cohesive performance and can be used for production of a&nbsp;wide range of self-adhesive materials.

Both cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) complexes have been investigated for their antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial and antitumor properties [13-24]. Cobalt(III) compounds have been explored for their biological activity since 50' of XX century and they are still being examined especially for their anticancer properties. Oncological diseases are still actual and very important problem. The new mechanism of drug action has been researched. Development of tumor-selective cytotoxic agents, which would strongly injure tumor cells but affect as little as possible the normal tissues and organs having no side effect on a&nbsp;patient's organism, plays a&nbsp;key role [25]. The search for selective anticancer drugs (tumor-activated prodrugs; TAP) led to compounds that can exploit the characteristic, unique microenvironment of tumor cells, such as selective enzyme expression, low extracellular pH and hypoxia. Tumor hypoxia provides a&nbsp;basis for the selective targeting of solid tumor [3]. This property has been explored for reduction by endogenous enzymes or radiation for quinones, N-oxides and nitroaromatics. Complexes of nitrogen-based ligands with many transition metals such as cobalt have been investigated as potential hypoxia activated prodrugs. Such complexes are very stable in the low-spin Co(III) oxidation state. They have reduction potentials in the appropriate range to undergo reduction by cellular reductases, but this is inhibited in oxygenated cells, apparently by competition for cellular reductants between the Co(III) complex and oxygen [4].\nCobalt(III) plays \"passive\" role in the complexes, but it chaperones and delivers cytotoxic ligand, which is deactivated when coordinated to the metal centre. In hypoxic regions of reduction to cobalt(II), the anticancer agent would be released from less stable Co(II) complex and thereby activated in their sites of action. Many studies have described developments and prospect for cobalt(III) - based pharmaceuticals for their red-ox properties as promising antitumor agents - hypoxia activated prodrugs [2]. Structure, enhanced reactivity with potential biological targets upon reduction, correlations between electrochemical parameters and anticancer activity in hypoxic tumor cells have been presented for cobalt complexes of nitrogen mustards or Schiff bases. Moreover Co(III) complexes of azahydroxy-CBI toxins show selective toxicity following irradiation under hypoxic but not aerobic conditions as potential hypoxia-selective cytotoxins.

            "abstract": "Mycophenolic acid (MPA) 1 (Fig. 1) is one of the most substituted phtalides. Its chemical structure incorporates a&nbsp;highly functionalized, hexasubstituted benzene ring [3, 4]. This compound is one of the oldest known antibiotics [1, 2]. MPA is the most potent uncompetitive inhibitor of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This enzyme catalyzes a&nbsp;rate - limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides [13]. Mycophenolic acid as an IMPDH inhibitor functions as antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial and immunosupressive agent [5-11]. Its derivatives: mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; CellCept(r), Roche AG) and mycophenolate sodium (MPS; Myfortic(r), Novartis Pharma AG) are used in combination with corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (cyclospo-rine a&nbsp;or tacrolimus) for the treatment and prophylaxis of organ rejection in solid organ transplants. The metabolic lability of mycophenolic acid and severe side effects in clinical treatment are the main reasons for the development of new synthetic pathways of its derivatives [14].\nThis paper reviews the most important approaches in mycophenolic acid synthesis and its derivatives and displays structure-reactivity relationships of these compounds. Synthesis of mycophenolic acid as one of the highest substituted phtalide is described [23-35]. The most common synthetic approach in preparation of highly substituted benzenes is by using benzene ring constructions with five or six required substituents [28-30]. First of these methods [25] is based on construction of the pentasubstituted resorcinol derivative via thermal addition of the alkynyl ether to the cyclobutenone (Scheme 3). The synthetic strategy of the second method [28, 30] is depicted in Scheme 4 and the key step of this approach involves reaction between 16 and 17. Alternative approach to total mycophenolic acid synthesis is preparation of its intermediates [31]. Mycophenolic acid derivatives were divided into five groups, according to their chemical structure. For each of them synthetic pathway was shown and structure-biological activity relationships were described [40]. It has been found that replacement of the mycophenolic acid lactone ring with other cyclic groups resulted in loss of potency. a&nbsp;phenolic hydroxyl group and the aromatic methyl substituent were found to be essential for high activity. Replacement of the methoxy group with ethyl, vinyl or methyl resulted in compounds with higher activity than mycophenolic acid itself [41]. It has also been discovered that substitution with small alkyl groups in the ? position to the carboxylic group results in enhanced potency [46]. Furthermore monocyclic and indol derivatives were obtained and the carboxyamide derivative was selected for screening against prostate cancer [54]. Also new monocyclic analogues were obtained but they did not show any anticancer activity [55]. There have been synthesized several analogues of mycophenolic adenine dinucleotide [50-52] or mycophenolic adenine methylene-bis(sulfonamide)s [53] which showed inhibitory activity against IMPDH. Recently, a&nbsp;series of novel IMPDH inhibitors based on a&nbsp;methoxy-(5-oxazolyl)-phenyl (MOP) moiety have been designed [56].

            "abstract": "Compounds with lactone moiety exhibit many biological acitivities (for example antimicrobial, antifeedant, cytostatic). One of the most attractive methods to obtain optically active lactones are regio- and stereoselective biotransformations. These together with mild reaction conditions are the main advantages of the processes compared to chemical synthesis of lactones. In this review examples of such biotransformations are presented.\nThe lactones may be obtained via direct biotransformation of substrate or in chemoenzymatic synthesis. In the second case the enzymatic step is the key one, leading to optically pure or enriched intermediate which is further transformed into desired, optically active product.\nAs the products of direct biotransformation, lactones can be formed from fatty acids like ricinoleic or vernolic acid [1, 2], aromatic compounds (benzoic acid, mandelic acid, catechol) [3] as well as in the result of lactonization of epoxyesters by enzymatic systems of fungi or plants. In the last case the biocalysts is the apple pulp or Jerusalem artichoke pulp [4-6]. Hydrolysis of amides and nitriles is also applied to the synthesis of lactones. Especially useful in this regard are microorganisms, which exhibit both enzymatic activities [7-9]. Microbial reduction of carbonyl group in ketoesters or ketoacids is also very useful method. The reduction may occur in \u03b3 or \u03b4 position, leading to \u03b3- or \u03b5-hydroxyacids which cyclize to the corresponding lactones [10-13]. Reduction of carbonyl group in \u03b2-position is the first step of a&nbsp;synthesis of lactones with 7- or 8-membered rings [14-16].\nThe application of hydrolysis or transesterification processes catalyzed by hydrolytic enzymes, mainly lipases from Pseudomonas sp., also leads to enzymatically enriched lactones. The substrates may be \u03b3-ketoesters, \u03b3-hydroxyamides, meso-diols or meso-diesters [10, 17-19]. Among the oxidation reaction the most known is Baeyer-Villiger reaction in which cyclic ketones are directly oxidized to the lactones by enzymes called Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMO) [20]. The reaction is highly regioselective and can be applied to the production of unsaturated lactones [23]. In this area of research genetically modified strains of Escherichia coli are applied [21, 24], although the wild strains are also used, for example to the production of \u03b5-caprolactone from cyclohexanone [22].\nAnother reaction catalyzed by oxidoreductases is the oxidation of hydroxyl group to carbonyl or carboxyl one [25-27]. In this first case horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) found application in the oxidation of meso-diols to lactones. The ability of different fungal strains to the regioselective hydroxylation of unactivated carbon atom found an application to the synthesis of lactones with eudesmane and germacrane systems [28-30].\nResolution of racemates is an alternative strategy used to the synthesis of lactones in optically pure forms. This aim can be achieved by enzymatic cleavage of lactone ring catalyzed by lactonases. These enzymes of microbial origin belong to esterases and are often induced during the growth of microorganisms on cyclic ketones as the carbon sources [31, 32, 34]. Enzymatic resolution of pantolactone by lactonase from Fusarium oxysporum is an example of industrial biotransformation [33]. Lipases can also be applied to the enantioselective hydrolysis of lactone ring [35-37].\nThe other functional groups present in the molecule can also be converted during the resolution of racemic lactones [39-44]. The examples are hydrolysis of acetoxylactones or esterification of hydroxylactones.

            "abstract": "In marked contrast to enantioselective Michael reactions promoted by chiral Lewis acids, organocatalytic Michael reactions have not been used as standard transformation in organic chemistry until quite recently. During the past few years chiral organocatalysts have emerged as a&nbsp;broadly applicable class of catalysts for enantioselective Michael reaction. This review summarizes these advances emphasizing the structural and mechanistic features that contribute to high enantioselectivity in organocatalytic Michael reactions.\nThe first part of this review deals with the development of covalent catalysis in organocatalytic asymmetric Michael reactions. To date, several chiral secondary amines have been employed to promote formation of electron-rich enamines from enolizable aldehydes and ketones, which then react with various \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated electrophiles to afford products [7-24]. In contrast, chiral imidazolidinones and diarylprolinol ethers are most often used to activate \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds by forming electron-deficient iminium ions, which render the \u03b2-carbon more electrophilic then their carbonyl precursors for nucleophilic attack [2a, 7, 25-34].\nThe second part of this review documents the development of non-covalent catalysis [35-64]. In this regard, chiral Bronstedt bases [35-39], chiral phase-transfer catalysts [40-49] and chiral hydrogen-bond donors [50-64] have emerged in the past few years as readily accessible organocatalysts of asymmetric Michael reaction. The most efficient catalysts such as cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, quaternary ammonium salts obtained from cinchona alkaloids and chiral thiourea derivatives, respectively are revived and the modes of actions are discussed.\nFurthermore, the major developments of organocatalytic asymmetric Michael reactions are also reviewed.

            "abstract": "Cyclic, 5-membered derivatives of three- and tetracoordinated phosphorus constitute an important group of organophosphorus compounds in light of their increased reactivity towards nucleophilic reagents. This surprising reactivity is caused by steric strain present in 5-membered heterocyclic ring, which is then released on formation of reaction intermediates possessing pentacovalent phosphorus atom. This problem was thoroughly analyzed by Westheimer in his classical paper [13]. The title cyclic compounds found an application in the chemical synthesis of biophosphates such as phospholipid derivatives [15-17, 19-21] or nucleoside phosphates [14, 18], however, in spite of numerous efforts (especially by the groups of Ugi and Ramirez) their applicability to efficient formation of internucleotide linkage was rather limited [22-26]. Further development of this matter was achieved by Stec and coworkers [27], who in 1991 applied appropriately protected P-chiral nucleoside- -3'-O-(2-thiono-1,3,2-oksathiaphospholane)s for the synthesis of stereoregular oligo(nucleoside phosphorothioate)s. In fact, the oxathiaphospholane method was for many years a&nbsp;unique successful approach to stereocontrolled synthesis of phosphorothioate analogs of oligonucleotides. The method was later modified and applied for preparation of other phosphorothioate analogs of nucleotides [29-36], including compounds not containing sulphur [37-39]. Further modification led to so called dithiaphospholane approach, allowing an efficient synthesis of oligo(nucleoside phosphorodithioate)s [40] and other phosphorodithioate analogs of nucleotides [41-44]. An alternative approach to the synthesis of stereoregular oligo(nucleoside phosphorothioate)s, involving an application of P-chiral nucleoside oxazaphospholidine derivatives had at first a&nbsp;limited success (Agrawal et al. [45-47], Beaucage et al. [48]), however, recent achievements of Wada et al. [49] made compounds of this series efficient precursors for stereocontrolled synthesis of phosphorothioate analogs of oligonucleotides.

Wide spectrum of pollutants reaches particular environmental compartments. Pollutants present in abiotic part of the environment undergo numerous processes of transport and physicochemical changes which lead to appearance of new compounds. From abiotic environmental compartment chemicals reach plants, animals and - finally - human beings. It should be remembered that toxic substances present in the environment can lead to permanent damage not only in the case of particular species but also of entire ecosystems. For this reason, it is important to undertake proper actions in monitoring of emission and reduction of emission of pollutants to particular environmental compartments, as well as assessment of threats resulting from already introduced toxins.\nPresently realized chemical monitoring enables conducting identification and quantitative determination of chemicals of possible toxic action only in narrow range. Furthermore, serious limitation of this system of quality assessment of particular environmental elements are present due to complex interactions that occur between pollutants and their varying bioavailability.\nBioanalytical methods appear as a&nbsp;solution for abovementioned problem, where proper living organisms are used as indicators of burden degree of given environmental compartment by different kinds of xenobiotics. Toxicity tests, in other words bioassays, can constitute source of information on summary burden of samples tested by differentiated in kind and amount mixture of pollutants (also with taking into account mutual interactions between them) [1-5].\nLandfills pose very specific manifestation of anthropopression, where application of ecotoxicological tests can greatly contribute to more effective protection of surface and underground water resources. Due to fact that in Poland until 1970 there no obligations to monitor content of wastes gathered in communal landfills, very often also dangerous wastes were directed there; mostly in form of batteries, fluorescent lamps, lacquer wastes, overdue pharmaceuticals and plants protection chemicals, postproduction wastes as well as used oils and lubricates.

Therefore, routine monitoring and control of mercury are becoming increasingly important in natural environment. Several analytical techniques have been developed for the determination of mercury and cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CV-AAS) is the most widely used one. However, CV-AAS is not straightforwardly applicable to some environmental, clinical, or biological samples in view of low analyte content and matrix of the sample. Atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) detection, especially coupled with the cold vapor (CV) technique, is becoming popular and replacing atomic absorption spectroscopy for mercury analysis due to its simple instrumentation, relatively low cost of operation, high sensitivity and selectivity and ultra low detection limits, which can be evidenced by its approval by the US Environmental Protection Agency for the analysis of mercury in uncontaminated water.\nSpeciation analysis brings important information on the real toxicity and migration pathways of mercury. The need for this kind of information has stimulated development of analytical solutions allowing separation of mercury species such as sequential extraction procedures and hyphenated techniques. The paper presents perspectives of development and application of determinations of total mercury and mercury species in environmental samples by the atomic fluorescence spectroscopy method based on cold vapor generation (CV-AFS). The different sequential extraction procedures in estimation of mercury mobility and bioavailability were also critically reviewed. Ranges of published detection limits achievable for mercury species determination by using different hyphenated techniques are also given. High pressure liquid chromatography coupled to AFS has become a&nbsp;very important tool in determination of mercury species in environmental samples in last years.\nThe paper presents the possibilities of current analytical methods available with use this technique.

The exceptional importance of fresh water quality rests on the fact that it determines condition and development of all human beings as well as animals and plants.\nIn sections 1 and 3 a&nbsp;concise description of the two methods of pattern recognition was presented. CA provides visual presentation of clustering mode of samples or variables in the form of tree-like scheme called dendrogram [3, 9]. Samples which exhibit considerable similarity fall into one cluster and at the same time they differ to the greatest extent from samples belonging to other clusters [1, 70-74]. PCA enables significant reduction of data matrix dimension without an excessive loss of information [5, 6, 82]. In addition, PCA provides intelligible graphic visualization of the data structure by scattering samples, described by many variables, on plane formed by the following principal components [74].\nIn CA methods of calculation the distance between different clusters or objects in a&nbsp;hierarchical dendrogram were also mentioned [75]. They define whether two clusters or objects are sufficiently similar to be joined together into one cluster. It was also denoted that among most commonly applied methods Ward's clustering method turns out to be the best and most effective for surface water monitoring results as it gives the largest number of correctly classified observations.\nThe sections 2 and 4 present several examples of the two multidimensional chemometric techniques application in assessment of surface water quality. It was perceived that CA and PCA allow classification of sampling stations in relation to chemical composition of water and therefore permit to pinpoint areas with similar water quality [5, 82]. CA and PCA also help to indicate areas with distinctive chemical composition of water [6, 73, 90, 105]. They also help to identify factors which determine water quality at different regions [4, 5, 88, 113]. When applied for the results acquired from one watercourse at different sites CA and PCA enable to examine changes of water quality downstream [73, 80, 114]. The two chemometric methods are also useful tools for determination if season of sampling or specific weather conditions can influence variation of physicochemical parameters of water [90, 95, 103]. Other chemometric methods applied for monitoring results evaluation are mentioned in section 5 [74, 75, 116].

It constitutes approximately 90% of orange and grapefruit peel oil [5] and hence it is potentially available in large amounts as a&nbsp;by-product of the citrus industry [21]. In contrast to relatively inexpensive limonene, products of its oxidation, such as: ?-terpineol, carveol, carvone, perillyl alcohol, menthol and limonene oxide (Fig. 5), are compounds of a&nbsp;very high market value [16] and they are widely used (apart from the epoxide) in the flavor and fragrance industry [7]. Limonene oxide can be applied as a&nbsp;building block in the synthesis of drugs [18, 19] and biodegradable polymers [20].\nSince an industrial method of limonene conversion into its ketone - carvone (used as a&nbsp;mint flavor for foods and oral hygiene products [7]) - involves several stages and the use of environmentally hazardous chemicals (Fig. 6) [21], it does not remain in accordance with 'green chemistry'. The latter problem concerns also the methods of limonene oxidation based on chromium(VI) compounds [25-28]. Hence a&nbsp;lot of attention is paid to limonene oxidation using environmentally benign oxidants, namely dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide.\nLiterature studies revealed that a&nbsp;variety of approaches to limonene oxidation by oxygen and hydrogen peroxide had been published so far. The oxidation of limonene using dioxygen can be performed catalytically and photochemically [80-86]. Generally, a&nbsp;complex mixture of limonene oxidated derivatives (Fig. 8) is obtained using Wacker-like systems [44-51] as well as all sorts of cobalt catalysts [52-56]. Transition metal complexes can also activate dioxygen for the oxidation of limonene giving a&nbsp;mixture of products [78, 79]. Limonene epoxides are usually produced by Mukaiyama systems, where peracid is in-situ generated from oxygen, aldehyde and transition metal complex [59-77].\nThe oxidation of limonene by hydrogen peroxide usually leads to its epoxidation [90-98, 100, 101]; however, sometimes other limonene derivatives are formed [99, 134-136]. Limonene oxidation using hydrogen peroxide proceeds in the presence of catalysts which are transition metal complexes [90-105], heteropolyanions [109-120], aluminum oxide [121-125] as well as titanium-containing catalysts [126-131]. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide reacts with nitriles forming peroxycarboximidic acid which can epoxidize limonene in Payne reaction [132, 133].

This review deals with the synthetic approaches of \u03b1,\u03b2-diamino acids and their derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) using asymmetric synthesis methods described in the literature up to the end of 2008. Aziridines and 3-amino-\u03b2-lactams are beyond the scope of this review and will be only considered as intermediates in the synthesis of acyclic derivatives.\nThe methods found in the literature can be classified essentially in two main categories: methods that require a&nbsp;new carbon-carbon single bond construction (Fig. 4) and method based on the functional groups transformation reactions within the carboxylic acids skeleton (Fig. 5).\nA great number of C-C forming methods are the addition reactions of glycine derivatives or nitro compounds to imines (Mannich-type reactions). The asymmetric induction requires chiral substrate usage (e.g., chiral sulfinimines, chiral glycinates) [30-37, 61-67] (Scheme 1-6, 22-24) or results from the application of chiral catalysts (e.g., chiral Lewis acids, chiral PTC catalysts and other organocatalysts) [39-48, 50-60] (Scheme 7-21). Strecker's reaction using chiral imines or related compounds is also often used [69-77] (Scheme 25-27).\nMethods begining from the existing carbon skeleton and based on the modification of the functional groups are as follows: catalytic asymmetric diamination and aminohydroxylation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carboxylic esters (Scheme 31-36) [92-100, 107-109]. Subsequent transformation of the hydroxy group into the amine group in the hydroxyamino acids derivatives is then necessary [100-109]. The direct introduction of the amino moiety into the \u03b2-amino esters via electrofilic amination is also described (Scheme 41-43) [120-131]. The title compounds can also be obtained by catalytic enantioselective reduction of dehydrodiamino acids derivatives (Scheme 40) [117-119].

            "abstract": "Contamination of environment with substances originated from industrial and military activity, including radioisotopes belongs to dangerous occurrences accompanying our life. Most anthropogenic radionuclides come from above ground nuclear weapon tests and as radioactive fallout were deposed in surface layer of soil. This way soil became source of their distribution [1]. Physicochemical properties of soil changes mostly in first genetic layers that is characteristic for specific soil type [2-4]. Translocation of radionuclides and mostly their vertical migration give information not only of contamination of studied area but also their transfer to plants [6-19]. Word literature has been dealing with migration of radionuclides for years [20-24]. The main factors influencing migration of radionuclides comprises their sorption on particles of soil, transportation with water, dispersion that is responsible for distribution in porous environment, precipitation and co-precipitation, half life time of the radionuclide. Moreover very important are: properties of the soil (type, soil organic matter contents, pH), genetic level, type of soil colloids, ionic composition of underground water, chemical form of radionuclide (free ion, compound) origin of contamination (nuclear power plant, nuclear explosion). Studies on migration of radionuclides mostly aim on describing the influence of selected factors on this process [30-42].\nSeparate place is devoted to studies on presence of radioisotopes in successive layers (vertical intersection) [6, 12-19, 25-29] and calculation on these data, among others, vertical migration rate. Special attention should be paid to elaboration of some theoretical models of vertical migration of anthropogenic radiouclides in depth of the Earth [16, 49-54]. Migrating in soil 90Sr belongs to radionuclides of average velocity, its mean migration rate down in soil is usually lower than 1cm/y [6, 51-54].

            "abstract": "A biorefinery is a&nbsp;facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's petroleum refineries, which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum [12]. Three biorefinery systems are distinguished in research and development [11, 13]: the \"whole-crop biorefinery\", the \"lignocellulosic biorefinery\" and the \"green biorefinery\". Moreover, a&nbsp;concept of \"two platform biorefinery\" emerged [14], which includes the sugar platform as a&nbsp;basis for (bio)chemical conversion of biomass and the syngas (thermochemical) platform which convert biomass into synthesis gas.\nThis review focuses on the recent developments of basic biorefinery technologies. The whole-crop biorefinery (Figure 1) produces chemicals from sugars by biochemical (Scheme 1) and chemical (Schemes 2-11) transformations, of which twelve compounds, selected by US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [14] are classified as \"block (or platform) chemicals\" with the potential to be transformed into new families (\"trees\") of valuable substances. These compounds are: 1,4-diacids (succinic, fumaric, malic), 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, aspartic acid , glutamic acid, glucaric acid, itaconic acid, levulinic acid, 3-hydroxybutyrolactone, glycerol, sorbitol, and xylitol/arabinitol. The lignocellulosic biorefinery (Figure 2) uses biomass consisting of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin - an abundant and cheap feedstock. Among the potential products of the \"sugar platform\" are: cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen obtained by biochemical routs, and furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, the platform chemicals, (Schemes 3-11), obtained by chemical synthesis. The \"syngas platform\" covers three basic processes: aqueous - phase reforming of sugar polyols [109-111, 113-115] and glycerol [116-118], fast pyrolysis of biomass [121-128] and gasification of biomass [121-125]. Aqueous - phase reforming of glucose and sorbitol produces hydrogen, whereas integrated with catalytic cascade processes allows to produce liquid biofuels, i.e., branched hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds used in gasoline or longer chain linear hydrocarbons in diesel and jet fuels. Fast pyrolysis produces bio-oil that can be upgraded to transportation fuels. Synthesis gas is produced in gasification processes and may be converted into methanol or liquid hydrocarbons (so-called synthetic \"Biomass-To-Liquid\", BTL-fuel) [131-133]. Finally, green biorefinery (Figure 3) uses green (wet) biomass rich in juice and oil to obtain food and non food goods, and from the latter a&nbsp;huge number of chemicals \"produced\" by Nature, i.e., by the vast diversity of plant.

The unique properties that can easily be tailored influence their attractiveness. Presently, the ionic liquids are used as solvents for numerous organic, inorganic, and organometallic compounds, including catalysts and cocatalysts of various reaction types [1-4]. Having polar, but weakly coordinating character, the ionic liquids were found to be a&nbsp;good medium for the olefin oligomerisation and polymerisation reactions carried out with the use of transition metal compounds [7, 10].\nThe ionic liquid enabled to perform the olefin oligomerisation (ethylene, propylene, butene) in the biphasic mode. Such system ensures high activity and selectivity of a&nbsp;catalyst, mild reaction conditions, and an easy separation of the products from the reaction mixture, what results in re-use of the catalyst in the multi-steps reaction cycles. Therefore, application of the ionic liquids overhelm the problems of the standard homogeneous oligomerisation processes [5, 6, 12-14].\nSimilarly, the ionic liquids can be applied in the olefin polymerisation with the use of organometallic catalysts. The most often used ionic liquids are those having imidazolium cation and chloroaluminate anion [10, 13-15]. They constitute not only a&nbsp;medium, but also they are a&nbsp;specific support of the catalyst precursor. Furthermore, they can participate in the catalytic process. It was found that even small modification of the ionic liquid cation can have considerable influence on the performance of the polymerisation reaction and the properties of the obtained product [10].\nIn the presented paper the actual trends concerning the oligomerisation and polymerisation reactions carried out in the ionic liquid medium are presented.

            "abstract": "The aim of this work was to present regularities in the phase equilibria in the Tl2Te-MxTey systems, where M stands for metals belonging to periods IV-VI and groups 11-15 of Periodical Table. Additionally, the Tl2Te-As2Te3, Tl2Se-Bi2Se3 and Tl2Te-Tl2Se systems were considered. The phase diagrams are presented in a&nbsp;simple form in Fig. 1 for the following systems: Tl2Te-Cu2Te [1], Tl2Te-ZnTe [2], Tl2Te-CdTe [3], Tl2Te-HgTe [4-6], Tl2Te-In2Te3 [7, 8], Tl2Te-PbTe [9], Tl2Se-Tl2Te [10], Tl2Se-Bi2Se3 [11], Tl2Te-Ga2Te3 [12], Tl2Te-Ag2Te [13], Tl2Te-SnTe [14], Tl2Te-Sb2Te3 [15], Tl2Te-Bi2Te3 [16], Tl2Te-GeTe [17] and Tl2Te-As2Te3 [18].\nThe state of phase equilibria illustrated by the phase diagram depends on the tendency to chemical compounds formation by the components of a&nbsp;system. This tendency can be observed in the number of compounds formed, their melting points and the type of melting process (congruent or noncongruent).\nThe tendency to compounds formation or at least the melting points of the compounds formed increases with increase of the atomic number of the metal within a&nbsp;group of systems containing as the second component tellurides of metals from a&nbsp;given group in the Periodic Table.\nThere is no correlation between type of phase diagram and metal position in a&nbsp;given period. Thus, increasing the number of outer shell electrons for consecutive elements M of the same group does not affect the tendency to the chemical compounds formation.\nRegardless of the compounds number - terminal solid solutions have been observed only in some telluride systems. The data in Table 1 show that solid solutions are formed when the value of relative difference between thallium and metal M radii is smaller than 10%.\nAll salt systems arranged in decreasing order of their ionic potentials ratios \u03bcTl+/\u03bcM+ are presented in Table 2. While this ratio decreases the tendency to congruent compounds formation increases abruptly from 1 to 2 at the value of a&nbsp;ratio equal to 0.21, exactly as in the case of typical salts [20].\nThe influence of molecular stability coefficients on the number of compounds existing in the system (Table 3) has been discussed. The greater difference is between the values of molecular stability coefficients the more compounds are formed.\nThe impact of a&nbsp;common anion change on the shape of phase diagrams for the systems Tl2Te-Bi2Te3 [16] and Tl2Se-Bi2Se3 [11] as well as the regularities in the chalcogenide systems with a&nbsp;common cation has been described.\nAll compounds being components of the systems presented in this work are listed in Table 4.

            "abstract": "Baeyer-Villiger (BV) reaction is oxidation of ketones, leading to cleavage of one of the C-CO-C bonds with simultaneous insertion of an oxygen atom into the cleaved bond. Resulting products obtained from cyclic ketones are lactones, while esters are obtained from acyclic ketones. Numerous strains of microorganisms produce enzymes catalyzing BV oxidation. These enzymes participate in the processes of degradation of natural and synthetic ketones, which can be used by the microorganisms as carbon source (Scheme 3 and 4). The enzymes are monooxygenases (Baeyer-Villigerases, BVMOs), usually containing flavinoadenine nucleotide and cooperating with NAD(P)H reductases.\nResearch on the role of BV oxidation in degradation processes has evolved into intensive studies on the mechanism of this reaction and its use in synthesis, especially after isolation (in 1976) of cyclohexane monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. NCIB9871(CHMOAcineto 1) [9]. Subsequently, further strains were identified which produced BVMOs catalyzing oxidation of ketones of diverse structures. In addition to the best-characterized cyclohexane monooxygenase, there are: cyclopentanone, phenylacetone, cyclododecanone, aliphatic ketone and 2-oxo-3-en-4,5,5-trimethyl-cyclopentenylacetic acid monooxygenases. The adjective characterizing a&nbsp;given BVMO is derived from the ketone constituting carbon source, or from the ketone which is oxidized with the highest yield. In addition to these ketones, the enzymes accept their various structural analogues, therefore it is possible to select a&nbsp;biocatalyst which carries out oxidation of a&nbsp;given substrate. Among BVMOs, particularly selective are the enzymes carrying out BV oxidation of steroidal ketones: these enzymes operate only on steroid substrates, mostly containing 3-oxo--4-en moiety, but also they exhibit regioselectivity as well - the oxidation of ketones takes place only at C-17. During the regioselective enzymatic oxidation, \"atypical\" lactones [2, 4], which are not produced in chemical BV oxidation processes, are sometimes formed. Products of stereoselective enzymatic reactions are optically pure lactones and esters, which are starting points for further asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds, including medicines.\nThe application of genetic engineering allows obtaining recombinant microbial strains, which are non-pathogenic and produce larger amounts of the enzyme than the wild-type strains. The recombinants are also able to produce mutated BVMOs exhibiting higher selectivity and/or lifetime, as well as activity towards different spectrum of substrates than the parent enzymes [2]. However, reaction yields of transformations carried out by the recombinants are still not significantly better than the results obtained with the wild-type strains. The recombinants usually require an expensive reagent, isopropyl-\u03b2 --D-tiogalactopyranoside (ITPG), to induce their BVMOs [23].\nEnzymatic BV oxidation, due to the selectivity of the enzymatic action, is competitive to the chemical oxidation. The enzyme selectivity allows for using pure products, including enantiopure compounds, with high yield. The process is environmentally friendly, because the oxidizer in the enzymatic BV reaction is molecular oxygen, and the amount of byproducts is limited.\nSynthetic application of BVMOs is limited by three principal factors: isolation of the enzyme in amounts suitable for large-scale applications, decrease in the enzymatic activity in the presence of the substrate and/or the product, and the isolation of the product. Separation of the unreacted enantiomer of the substrate in the process of kinetic separation of the racemic mixture, or separation of regioisomeric lactones are costly and time-consuming operations. Another possible problem is the fact that some strains producing useful BVMOs are pathogenic. Therefore, multidirectional research efforts are devoted to overcome the aforementioned barriers with the goal of establishing economically viable methods of biotransformations [4].

            "abstract": "Intercalators constitute a&nbsp;group of compounds which interact reversibly with DNA double helix. The insertion of planar, polycyclic aromatic systems between adjacent base pairs leads to topological changes in the double helix (lengthening, unwinding) and disrupts replication, transcription and repair processes [1-4]. Some of the monointercalators e.g. doxorubicin are valuable drugs, but their clinical effectiveness is limited by their undesirable side effects, and development of multidrug resistance [12]. In order to overcome these limitations bisintercalators have been designed. Dimerization of monointercalating compounds was supposed to enhance their anticancer activity and minimize side effects [1, 7].\nMany research groups have been interested in designing various groups of bisintercalating agents of diverse chemical structure and biological properties, such as echinomycin antibiotics [5, 7-10], 7H-pyridocarbazole derivatives [19-21], bisanthracyclines [7, 12, 16], bisnaphthalimides [7, 22-37], bisacridines [38-48] and bisimidazoacridones [50-52].\nThere have been a&nbsp;number of modifications undertaken on polyaromatic rings, and linker chains in an attempt to improve the compounds' activity.\nThe structure-activity relationships have been suggested. It has been discovered that introduction of small lipophilic substituents or additional heterocycles into ring systems may lead to significant changes in binding affinity and cytotoxic activity of the compounds.\nIt was discovered that many tumor types contained elevated polyamine levels and an active polyamine transporter for importing exogenous polyamines. Designing bisintercalators with aminoalkyl chains similar to polyamines has given a&nbsp;chance to improve selectivity in drug delivery to rapidly proliferating cells by utilizing the polyamine transporter. More extensive SAR studies revealed significant influence of length and rigidity of a&nbsp;linker binding two intercalating moieties on binding affinity and antiproliferative activity of bisintercalators.\nIntercalation and topoisomerases inhibition are not the only possible modes of action of the compounds. Some of them exert cytotoxic effect through induction of apoptosis e. g. bisnaphthalimidopropylspermidine (BNIPSpd, (29) Fig. 9) or disrupting repair process of DNA double helix (WMC-26, (55) Fig. 18).\nIn this work we presented enormous chemical diversity of bisintercalators and depicted multiplicity of structural modification of dimeric molecules which may lead to enhanced cytotoxic activity becoming valuable anticancer drugs.

Structure, morphology, optical and electrical properties were characterized. Size effects and their influence on the mentioned physicochemical properties were discussed. Strong effect of the dopant concentration on the structure of BaTiO3 was found. In case of the Eu3+ ions doping results in stabilization of tetragonal phase of BaTiO3 whereas addition of the Yb3+ ions favors formation of the cubic structure. Besides that all introduced ions could be considered as inhibitors for the grain growth process. Moreover resulted powders showed co-existence of the tetragonal (ferroelectric) and cubic (paraelectric) phases. The amount of the tetragonal phase depends on the heat treatment temperature and concentration of the incorporated rare earth ions.\nThe structural changes of a&nbsp;matrix were studied using the Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions as optical probes. Their luminescence properties were dependent on the sintering temperature. In case of the Eu3+ ions we have found that the intensities of 5D0\u21927F2 transitions increased with the increasing temperature. It means higher Eu3+ ions symmetry associates with higher temperature [1-4]. On the other hand in nano-crystals doped with Yb3+ ions a&nbsp;higher intensity of SHG (second harmonic generation) was observed in the tetragonal phase, whereas the isotropic cubic phase was detected by the absence of a&nbsp;SHG signal. Cooperative emission, indicating the presence of Yb3+ ion pairs, was easily detected in the cubic phase and not seen in the ferroelectric tetragonal structure [5].\nBaTiO3 nanoceramics were fabricated from the nanopowders using LTHP (low-temperature high pressure) sintering process [6, 7]. The impedance spectra indicated the complex nature of the effects appearing in the analyzed BaTiO3 nanoceramics. Four types of physical mechanisms contributing to the overall conductivity were found, namely hopping, diffusion, two relaxation mechanisms and the dc conduction. The studied samples show a&nbsp;ferroelectric-paralelectric phase transition observed for the higher frequency regions.

These two factors play a&nbsp;decisive role from the point of view of catalytic activity of nanoclusters.\nPalladium nanoparticles have been obtained by chemical reduction of PdCl2 aqueous solution using pyrogallol, hydrazine or chromium(II) acetate as the reducing agent. All these systems have demonstrated a&nbsp;very high catalytic activity in important carbon-carbon bond forming reactions (methoxycarbonylation, Heck and Suzuki processes) carried out under mild conditions [48, 49]. Some of the C-C coupling reactions have also been successfully catalyzed by nickel nanoparticles, however they require more harsh conditions [65, 66].\nCobalt and iron nanoparticles present magnetic properties attractive for application of these materials as removable electronic media of high capacity, as well as biosensors or magnetic probes for biological imaging and therapeutic use [9, 18]. The extreme reactivity of nanoparticles, specifically towards oxygen and water, complicates their synthesis, however it is also beneficial in catalytic applications [16, 17]. Conversion of CO/H2 mixture to hydrocarbons, known as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, representing one of the most important routes to fuels production, is catalyzed very effectively by iron and cobalt nanoparticles. Monometallic and bimetallic cobalt nanoparticles are excellent catalysts of Pauson-Khand type couplings leading to cyclopentanones [17].

            "abstract": "The aim of this review is to evaluate the use of chemiluminescence (CL) as the method for determination of a&nbsp;wide group of organic and inorganic compounds. Chemiluminescence can be defined as the light emission resulting from the transition of an electronically excited state produced in a&nbsp;reaction [1, 2]. CL, in spite of complicated processes occurring in reaction systems, has been used since many years in chemical analysis [13, 22, 30]. Although many chemiluminescence reagents investigated, only a&nbsp;limited number, such as luminol, tris(2,2-bipyridyl)ruthenium(III), potassium permanganate and the Fenton reaction, generating chemical sources of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, were successfully used for analytical applications. The Fenton system Fe(II)/(III)-H2O2 is the source reactive oxygen species and hydrogen radicals [52, 53]. Analytical techniques based on CL have been used in, e.g.: pharmacological studies, clinical and environmental diagnostics [14-17, 22-30, 39-47, 62-65]. Ultra-weak intensity of generated emission (1-104 h\u03bd \u00b7 s-1 \u00b7 cm-2) requires very sensitive detectors and special apparatus, as our detection system for CL measurements based on single photon counting [11].\nStudies of CL systems characterised by low intensity of the CL emission require the use of sensitizers. Due to their specific luminescence properties, the lanthanide ions, mainly europium(III) and terbium(III) and their complexes, can be successfully used as chemiluminescence fluorophores [11, 57, 71, 75, 76]. Examples of chemiluminescent methods used for determination of organic molecules (aminoacids, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics), based on the lanthanide(III) ions emission, as a&nbsp;result of the energy transfer process from the excited products of the organic molecule oxidation to the Ln(III), are presented [77, 78].

            "abstract": "One of the major drawbacks of solution phase organic synthesis is laborious processes of purification and isolation of individual products. Problems intensify in the case of preparation of compound libraries for pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. Application of oligomeric or polymeric specific reagents in purification processes can simplify significantly the isolation of organic products. Techniques of purification with reactive polymers have been worked out in the mid-1990s independently by groups of Kaldor, Flynn and Hodge as solid phase scavenging, complementary molecular reactivity and molecular recognition (CMR/R) or polymer-supported quench (PSQ), respectively [55-58]. They are based on differences in the reactivity of impurities in comparison to desired products with reference to functional groups of polymers. The methodologies have been intensively developed for the last decade as an effective alternative to time-consuming and somehow difficult classical methods of purification such as extraction in water-organic solvent systems, chromatography, crystallization or distillation [23, 25]. As a&nbsp;result of that, many new scavenging resins were synthesized and commercialized [51-54]. Their application seems to be particularly useful for purification of products from combinatorial synthesis. The synthesis of libraries of amides, carbamides, sulfoamides or amines can be taken as examples. The methods are also useful in many cases when classical methods of purification do not give desired effects. Removing of metal ions impurities from pharmaceutical products can be a&nbsp;good example [109]. The effectiveness of purification by reactive polymers was proven both in the case of single reactions and multi-step transformations.\nIn this review the basic principles of using functionalized polymers in purification of organic reaction products were described. The division of scavenging resins depending on the chemical nature of functional group immobilized on polymers and their applications was performed. Methods of synthesis of different types of oligomeric and polymeric scavengers and their morphology were discussed. Numerous examples of practical applications of scavenging resins in modern organic synthesis were presented. Keywords: functionalized polymers, polymer-supported reagents, scavenging resins",

            "abstract": "Thiols are chemically and biochemically very active components of the sulfur cycle of the natural environment. Low molecular-mass thiols, such as homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine and glutathione are critical cellular components that play numerous roles in metabolism and homeostasis, and are important in a&nbsp;variety of physiological and pathological processes [1, 2]. Plasma thiols are being investigated as potential indicators of health status and disease risk [3-8].\nBecause of high affinity to oxidation low-molecular-mass thiols exist in biological samples mostly as symmetrical, unsymmetrical and protein-bound disulfides. Thus, determination of total thiol content must comprise disulfide bond disruption step. a&nbsp;reducing agent is necessary both for the reduction of the sulfide bonds and to keep the thiol in a&nbsp;reduced form until start of derivatization.\nMost of thiols lack the structural properties necessary for the production of signals compatible with common HPLC detectors, such as UV absorbance and fluorescence. Therefore, an analyst must resort to derivatization for signal enhancement and labile sulfhydryl group blocking if fluorescence or UV-Vis detection methods are employed. Ultraviolet detection is less specific and less sensitive than fluorescence one, nevertheless, its sensitivity is sufficient for detection and quantitation of endogenous and exogenous thiols in biological samples in physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, equipment for HPLC-UV analysis is often a&nbsp;part of an existing, standard instrumentation in hospital laboratories and staff is usually well experienced in its use. All methods, except those based on electrochemical and tandem-mass spectrometry detection, depend on pre- or post-column derivatization of thiols. Useful reagents must form thiol derivatives with sufficient absorption and/or fluorescent yield to measure thiols at trace concentrations. Furthermore, the ideal reagent should show no absorption and should react rapidly and specifically with thiols to form stable products. Numerous reagents are available for the thiol derivatization. a&nbsp;majority of the reagents can be classified by type of the reactive moiety into three categories: activated halogen compounds, disulfides, and compounds possessing maleimide moiety, and are reviewed with some experimental details in excellent works [36-41].

            "abstract": "Molecular sieves are porous, crystalline materials usually synthetic or natural zeolites, that contain well-defined pores of precise and uniform size. The term zeolite originally described a&nbsp;group of natural crystalline aluminosilicates, however nowadays the term covers many different materials such as aluminophosphates or gallium-silicalites. During the last few decades microporous and mesoporous materials have been considered for medical use due to biological properties and stability in biological environment [1-4]. Zeolites have been investigated as drug carriers, dietetic supplements, antimicrobial agents or as adjuvants in anticancer therapy [3-9].\nUnique 'magnetic' zeolite was obtained by Shan et al. Zeolite nanocrystals were in situ combined with superparamagnetic magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles in the hydrothermal synthesis procedure. An high amount of enzymes adsorption and a&nbsp;good biocatalytic performance is shown by those newly formed magnetite/zeolite composite nanoparticles [15].\nZeolite of the CuX type has been used as a&nbsp;support for a&nbsp;antitumoral drug-cyclophosphamide. The in vivo tests show that the intensity of the antitumoral effects of the CuX zeolite- cyclophosphamide system is similar in comparison to the one achieved by cyclophosphamide alone [21]. Ion-exchanged zeolites have also been used as a&nbsp;novel approach to storage and delivery of nitric oxide (NO) [16]. Zeolite surface coatings offer antimicrobial protection through the controlled release of antimicrobial agent and can be applied to different types of surfaces or incorporated in many types of polymers [17, 18]. Rivera group prove that both zeolitic materials and drugs could be simultaneously administrated to a&nbsp;patient without any loss of an individual pharmaceutical effect of each product [22]. Zeolite matrix has been also used to stabilize erythromycin solutions. An existing commercial product based on diisopropylsebacate/ethanol solution of 4% erythromycin and zinc acetate (Zineryt(r), Yamanouchi Pharma) has been compared to analogical system where active compounds are loaded into porous material [26].\nNatural clinoptilolite is the main and active component of the antidiarrheal drug acting as adsorbent of bile acids, Aflatoxine B and Glucose [64]. Recent studies show that this material can also be utilized as an adjuvant in anticancer therapy [10-13, 46-47]. The new antacid drug Neutacid(r) is based on the neutralizing capacity of the purified natural zeolite - clinoptilolite from the Tasajera deposit (Cuba) for therapy of patients suffering from hyperacidity produced by gastric dyspepsia and gastric-duodenal ulcer [50]. Mesoporous material MCM-41, due to the pore size tunability and functionalization possibilities, can especially encapsulate a&nbsp;variety of different drug molecules and release them in controlled ways [27, 28, 30-36]. Zeolites containing silver ions are used as antimicrobial agents [53-57]. Zeolites are the main ingredient of commercially available anti-bleed agents [67].

            "abstract": "Bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) is a&nbsp;potent immunostimulator and immune adjuvant. Numerous studies reported on immunoactivities of bacterial PGN, most of which have been reproduced by a&nbsp;chemically synthesized low-molecular PGN fragment, muramyldipeptide (MDP) 1 (Fig. 1) [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13]. Another type of PGN fragment, desmuramylpeptides (DMPs), has also been chemically synthesized to mimic PGN containing meso-DAP, and the DMPs exerted similar bioactivities to MDP. In 1984 [18] reported that \u03b3-D-Glu-meso-DAP was the minimum structural unit capable of eliciting bioactivities induced by DMPs. Recently demonstrated that intracellular protein carrying a&nbsp;nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), NOD2 an intracellular receptor for MDP and DMPs containing DAP was recognized by another NOD protein, NOD1 [8, 33]. Replacement of the N-acetylmuramyl moiety with various acyl groups thus represents an important approach to the design and synthesis of new immunologically active MDP analogues - desmuramylpeptides, e.g. FK-156 9, pimelautide 11 (Fig. 2), 7-(oxoacyl)-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamines, carbocyclic MDP analogues (Fig. 13) [3, 13] in which a&nbsp;more lipophilic cyclohexane ring is present instead of the polyhydroxy pyranose ring of D-glucosamine, and the adamantyl-substituted MDP analogue LK-415 (Fig. 8) [54]. The FK-156 isolated from Streptomyces olivaceogriseus [21, 22] and its synthetic analogue of FK-565 10 (Fig. 2) have been reported to be a&nbsp;potent stimulant of antibody production and free of pyrogenicity. These compounds with close structural resemblance to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan peptides, exhibit very interesting biological activities. Both FK-156 10 and FK-565 11 (Fig. 3) enhance host defense ability against microbial infections, exhibit strong antiviral activity and remarkable antitumor potency [2, 13, 14, 18].\nAlso other acyl-DMPs were obtained and their activity described (Table 1). The most promising DMPs analogues were series of phthalimido-DMPs 46-53 (Fig. 7). In these compounds N-acetylmuramic acid residue was replaced by various N-phthaloylated amino acids [42-49] or phthalimido substituted aminoethoxyacetic acid to give immunologically active acyclic MDP analogues like LK-423 46 (LK-413 47, LK-511 48, LK-512 49, LK-508 50) (Fig. 7) [42, 47-49]. LK-423 has been selected for further studies to develop an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical agent. In 2001 Gobec et al. [54] reported the synthesis of new adamantyl-DMPs LK-415 55 and LK-517 56 (Fig. 8) with 1-adamantyl-carboxamido moiety replacing N-acetylglucosamine fragment in MDP. Their efficiency in modulating the production of cytokines IL-12, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-10 was measured in vitro in ionomycin and PMA activated cultures of PBMC, co-incubated with the analogues tested. The results were compared with the activity of MDP. All substances were strong regulators of IL-12 synthesis and IFN\u03b3 synthesis as well. Introduction of diethyl phosphonate moiety into LK-517 was of great importance for augmented T-cell cytokine production. Dzierzbicka et al. [55] described synthesis of three analogues of DMPs 57a,b, 58 modified with an amino-acridine/acridone residue. The screening data indicate that the analogues 57a,b and 58 (Fig. 9) exhibit low cytotoxic activity. Uehara et al. [59] reported MDP and DAP-containing desmuramylpeptides in combination with chemically synthesized Toll-like receptor agonists (Fig. 10) synergistically induced production of IL-8 in a&nbsp;NOD2- and NOD1-dependent manner, respectively, in human monocytic cells in culture. In 2008 Kawasaki et al. [33] designed synthesis of DAP containing PGN fragments and tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) (Fig. 5) and investigated their biological activity. Recently, N-acetylglucosamine-1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide (Fig. 12) and evaluation of its turnover by AmpD from Escherichia coli has been reported [61]. The synergism of MDP and DMPs with other chemotherapeutics is also promising in the therapy of many infectious and anticancer diseases.\nThis paper reviews the most important approaches to desmuramylpeptides (DMPs), their derivatives and displays structure-reactivity relationships of these compounds.

            "abstract": "From the chemical and electrochemical points of view aminophenol isomers are a&nbsp;group of compounds which can exhibit the properties typical of both the amines and/or phenols [1-5]. The position of the amine group and hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring is decisive to determine different properties of particular isomers. As concerns the chemical properties, including the ability to form electroactive films, out of the ortho, meta [6, 7] and para [6, 8, 9] isomers of aminophenol the o-aminophenol (oAP) seems to be the most important. The paper presents the process of chemical [12-16] and electrochemical [20-32] oxidation of oAP based on literature data. The products of chemical oxidation are: 2-aminophenoxasin-3-one of quinone diimine and quinones. As a&nbsp;result of the process of electrochemical oxidation of oAP many products were obtained, depending on conditions in which the process was carried out. For the oAP polymer were proposed: the ladder network structure of closed type, the structure with partially open ring, or simultaneous co-existence of both these structures.\nThe preparation of polymer film from poly(o-aminophenol) (PoAP) as well as its structure and properties were also described. The preparation of PoAP film of determined structure depends largely on conditions in which the electropolymerization process is performed and also on the purity of oAP used as initial substrate [62, 63]. The electrochromic properties of the film depend on the potential applied in the course of electrode process, pH, and the kind of electrolyte anions [27, 58]. The potential range of electrical conductivity was also discussed, as well as transport across modified PoAP electrodes [71-74] and electrodeposition of metals on modified PoAP electrodes [75-77].\nThe paper presents some applications of oAP and PoAP, such as the modification of Amberlite XAD-2 resin [51], production of actinomycin D [52-57], or possibilities of their application in electrodes [80-86] and as anti-corrosion coating [88].\noAP is an important organic compound also in view of its impact on a&nbsp;living organism. Therefore some biochemical properties of oAP such as the metabolism of oAP in human erythrocytes [36-40] or the damage of DNA due to oAP [41-45] could not be omitted.

Special attention is paid to new carbon materials i.e. carbon nanotubes and carbon nanohorns (Figs. 1-3) [1, 2, 20-24, 28-41]. We report recent advances in this field showing the potential applicability of those materials in drug delivery systems. Special attention is paid to the systems where anti-cancer drug cisplatin was covalently bound to the edges or incorporated inside single-wall carbon nanohorns. We also discuss the applicability of buckysomes, especially in delivery of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs.\nFinally reports about toxicity of new forms of carbon are discussed and it is shown that many of them lead to contradictory conclusions [22, 42-55]. Keywords: drug delivery, adsorption, carbon materials, carbon nanotubes, nanohorns",

            "abstract": "White, or industrial, biotechnology is the application of biotechnology for the processing and production of chemicals, materials, and energy. White biotechnology uses enzymes and microorganisms to generate products in industrial sectors as diverse as pharmaceuticals and chemistry, food and feed, pulp and paper, textiles or detergents. This review gives an overview of the possible developments in the transition to bio-based production with a&nbsp;focus on the production of chemicals.\nImplementation of industrial biotechnology offers significant ecological advantages. Renewable agricultural crops are the preferential starting materials, instead of dwindling fossil resources such as crude oil and natural gas. This technology consequently has a&nbsp;beneficial effect on greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time supports the agricultural sector, delivering these raw materials. Moreover, industrial biotechnology frequently shows significant performance benefits compared to conventional chemical technology, such as a&nbsp;higher reaction rate, increased conversion efficiency, improved product purity, lowered energy consumption and significant decrease in chemical waste generation. The combination of these factors has led to the recent strong penetration of industrial biotechnology in all sectors of the chemical industry, particularly in fine chemicals but equally so for bulk chemicals such as plastics and fuels.\nThe chemical industry in Europe, which contributes about 28% of the world demand for chemicals, has identified industrial biotechnology as a&nbsp;key emerging technology area. The biorefinery concept offers numerous possibilities to integrate the production of bio-energy and chemicals. This will also provide substantially higher value-added economic activities, besides promoting production in agriculture and forestry. Shifting the resource base for chemical production from fossil feedstocks to renewable raw materials provides exciting possibilities for the use of industrial biotechnology-based process tools.\nIn a&nbsp;bio-based production, industrial biotechnology also interfaces with plant biotechnology (green biotechnology), where gene technology is applied to accelerate the process of plant breeding for crop improvement or for altering the composition of the feedstock for a&nbsp;desired product.\nThe concept of Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy and the vision of bio-economy in Europe to 2030 presented in so called \"Cologne Paper\" [82] are also briefly outlined.

            "abstract": "Planar electrochromatography in closed system (pressurized planar electrochromatography, PPEC) is the separation mode in which mobile phase is driven into movement by electroosmotic effect relative to adsorbent layer of the chromatographic plate. Solute band migration in the PPEC mode is governed by two effects: solute partition in a&nbsp;mobile phase - stationary phase system and electrophoresis when solutes undergo dissociation.\nDevelopment of the methodology and equipment for PPEC are described in the paper. Attributes of the mode such as high separation efficiency and selectivity changes relative to liquid chromatography, especially thin-layer chromatography, are discussed. The mode is characterized by relatively short separation time and high performance of the separating system. Plate height approaches the value equal to two particle diameter of the stationary phase (adsorbent layer). Different separation selectivity mentioned is especially advantageous for application in two dimensional separation. The example of such separation of a&nbsp;test dye mixture, applying high performance thin layer chromatography in the first dimension and pressurized planar electrochromatography in the second one, is also presented and discussed in the paper.\nThe mentioned advantages are very promising for development of the mode and its future application in laboratory practice. However, few main challenges concerned with production of chromatographic plates dedicated to the mode and construction of the equipment convenient for the operator are primary concern of future development of the mode.

            "abstract": "T Human serum albumin (HSA), the most prominent protein in plasma, binds different classes of ligands at multiple sites. HSA provides a&nbsp;depot for many compounds, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, holds some ligands in a&nbsp;strained orientation providing their metabolic modification, renders potential toxins harmless transporting them to disposal sites, accounts for most of the antioxidant capacity of human serum, and acts as a&nbsp;NO-carrier. Transport of metal ions is another prominent function of HSA. Metal ions carried by HSA include physiological Ca2+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+, toxic Cd2+ and Ni2+, and drug-derived Au+ and Pt2+. This broad specificity is due to the presence of distinct binding sites on HSA surface. The N-terminal binding site (in brief NTS, alternatively labeled as ATCUN motif) was the earliest to be identified. It is composed of the first three amino-acid residues of the HSA sequence, Asp-Ala-His. Another specific binding site for metal ions in HSA is located at the interface of domains i&nbsp;and II of the protein molecule. This site, labeled multimetal binding site (MBS), the coordination of metal ions at MBS is provided by His67, His247, Asn99 and Asp249. Cys34 provides the sole thiol group of HSA which is not engaged in intramolecular disulfide bridges. The Cys34 side chain is located at the bottom of a&nbsp;crevice, what results in a&nbsp;limited accessibility and elevated specificity in metal ion interactions. Cys34 was proposed to be the major site of Pt2+ and Au+ complexes interaction. HSA had been indicated to be a&nbsp;physiological carrier of Co2+ ions a&nbsp;long time ago. The interest in the binding of Co(II) ions to HSA has surged recently due to a&nbsp;proposal by Bar-Or et al. [1] of a&nbsp;new rapid clinical assay for myocardial ischemia. This assay (ACB test) is based on an interaction of Co(II) ions with HSA derived from blood serum, followed by DTT treatment. This test is based on an assumption that the clipping of two first residues of HSA is related to ischemia. The proposed molecular mechanism for this test is based on a&nbsp;further assumption of NTS is the primary binding site for Co2+ ions. However, several questions regarding the ACB test are still open, and the molecular mechanism is not clear. Recent studies strongly suggest that the primary binding sites of Co(II) are sites a&nbsp;and B and not the N-terminus.\nIn the field of MR imaging, there is a&nbsp;considerable interest in contrast agents that target serum albumin because they are retained in the vascular space for longer periods of time than low molecular weight MR agents and also have an enhanced water relaxivity due to slower rotation when bound to the large protein. Albumin in this case serves two purposes, to enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agent by slowing its rotation and to slow diffusion of the agent from blood vessels into the spaces between cells. Both features are useful for imaging of blood vessels (MR angiography). Simple aliphatic chains are sufficient to facilitate binding to HSA. a&nbsp;derivative of Gd-DOTMP bearing an 11-carbon chain, was found to bind at a&nbsp;minimum of five fatty acid binding sites on HSA molecule.

            "abstract": "Equilibrium or competition dialysis is a&nbsp;powerful tool for binding study of ligands that are expected to bind to nucleic acids with selectivity related to their structure or sequence. In the equilibrium dialysis experiment, a&nbsp;set of nucleic acid samples that differ in structure and sequence is dialyzed against a&nbsp;test ligand solution. After equilibration, the concentration of ligand bound to each structure or sequence is determined by UV-Vis absorption or fluorescence spectroscopy in each dialysis unit. Since all nucleic acid samples are in equilibrium with the same free ligand concentration, the amount of bound ligand is directly related to the ligand binding affinity. Thus, equilibrium provides a&nbsp;direct measure of selectivity and identifies the nucleic acid sample, which is preferred by a&nbsp;particular ligand. We describe here the principles and practice of the method. Examples of an application of the method are limited to the discovery of small molecules that selectively recognize the unique structural features of G-quadruplexes.\nThere are proofs for important functional roles of G-quadruplex structures in biology (maintenance of telomeres, transcriptional regulation, and modulation of mRNA translation). G-quadruplex DNA can exist in a&nbsp;variety of structural forms that may possess numerous potential binding sites for small molecules. Therefore equilibrium dialysis provides a&nbsp;useful tool for discovery of new small-molecule therapeutic agents targeting G-quadruplexes.\nKeywords: drug discovery; duplex; equilibrium dialysis; G-quadruplex; ligand binding; nucleic acids; structural selectivity; triplex",

            "abstract": "Conductometric titration (CT) is used as a&nbsp;complementary, non-specific technique against potentiometric (pH) titration (PT). The CT + PT procedure is applied to binary-solvent systems: HmL + Z/A + B (or HmL + Z/W + B) formed of a&nbsp;weak acid HmL and a&nbsp;pH-modifying agent z&nbsp;(e.g. NaOH, NH3 or HCl), and totally miscible organic solvents a&nbsp;and B (or w&nbsp;= H2O and B) chosen as co-solvents, where acid-base equilibria are considered. The solvent composition in such systems is expressed by the mole fraction x of B. Concentrations of solutes: HmL and z&nbsp;are the same in the solution titrated (titrand, D) and in titrant (T) and changes in pH value resulted only from differences in acid-base properties of solvents applied in D and T. On the basis of results obtained from PT and CT, the functional relationships related to the solutions of weak acids HmL (m = 1, 2, ...) were formulated, namely: (1) pKi = pKi(x) for acidity parameters; (2) \u039bp = \u039bp(x) for molar conductivities, related to the species formed by di- and triprotic acids. For this purpose, the Kohlrausch law on the independence of migrating ions has been applied. The pKi = pKi(x) relationships were formulated for diprotic and triprotic acids on the basis of Henderson-Hasselbalch functions and modeled with use of polynomial functions. The pKi(1) and \u039b p(1) values were obtained by extrapolation. The approach suggested is the essential novelty in contemporary literature related to the subject in question. This way, the paper provides a&nbsp;new methodology, a&nbsp;new dimension (x-scale) to the problems known hitherto.\nIn the experimental part, the pK1 = pK1(x) relationships were formulated for results of mutual pH titrations: HmL/B - HmL/W or HmL/B - HmL/A, obtained for the systems not involving Z. The systems were modeled with the use of Redlich-Kister (R-K) and orthogonal (normal, shifted) Legendre polynomials. Asymmetric functions by Myers-Scott (M-S) and by Micha\u0142owski were also suggested for this purpose. It was stated that all approximating functions fit the experimental data very well. The asymmetric functions are applicable for modeling of more bended relationships pK1 = pK1(x), particularly when referred to the limiting x-values in the interval . a&nbsp;software that enables to formulate the relationships pKi = pKi(x) according to different approximating functions after introducing the experimental data {(Vj, pHj) | j = 1, ..., N} obtained from PT, was also prepared, together with statistical evaluation of pKi(0) and pKi(1) values, obtained by extrapolation. The results thus obtained are presented in tables and figures.\nSome criteria of validity of the results obtained according to PT for pK1(0) and pK1(1) are also presented. The first criterion testifying about reversibility of indications of the measuring system is a&nbsp;position of the point of intersection of the plots obtained in the mutual titrations. The second criterion stems from comparison of results obtained from three pH titrations: (1) HmL/B \u2194 HmL/W, (2) HmL/B\u2194 HmL/A and (3) HmL/A \u2194 HmL/W. The convergence of the related plots at x = 0 and x = 1, where x = xB in (1) and (2) and x = xA in (3) testifies on account of the calibration procedure applied for glass electrode.

            "abstract": "For more than one hundred years, mercury fulminate (MF), lead azide (LA) and lead styphnate (LS) have been used as primary explosives (Fig. 1). They are very good initiatory explosives but they also suffer from serious drawbacks, such as: (a) extremely high sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, (b) thermal, hydrolytic, and chemical instability or lack of resistance to light, (c) incompatibility with metals commonly used in initiating devices, (d) high toxicity of the compounds themselves and their decomposition products [1, 2].\nThe ongoing search for new primary explosives is aimed at finding materials safer in production and use which do not contain heavy metals and exhibit better initiating performance than the multicomponent compositions being used now. The replacements of the present primaries should be more resistant to accidental stimuli (electrostatic discharge, impact, friction), but they must reliably inflame or detonate, e.g. upon exposure to flame, electrically heated wire or strike with a&nbsp;firing pin in stab and percussion initiators. However their thermal stability should not be too low in order to avoid unexpected explosions of ammunition exposed to heat flow from a&nbsp;fire. On the other hand some of the materials (detonants) must be capable of fast transition from deflagration to detonation. It is not easy to reconcile so many contradictory demands, but from the recently published papers, it appears that it may be possible [3-5].\nIt has been confirmed many times that some complex compounds with a&nbsp;general formula Mx(L)y(XO)z where M denotes a&nbsp;transition metal cation, L is a&nbsp;nitrogen rich ligand, and XO is an oxygen containing anion are effective primary explosives [3]. The cation plays structure-creating role (i.e. coordinates other molecules) providing stability of the compound and required level of safety. Usually it is also a&nbsp;catalyst of the first stage of decomposition which assures a&nbsp;rapid deflagration to detonation transition - inherent feature of primary explosives. In order to maximize the heat effect of decomposition, the oxygen balance of the compounds ought to be close to zero. Thanks to this the initiating performance of the new primaries may be higher than that of azides and flumintaes.\nIn this work we present a&nbsp;review of papers devoted to synthesis, chemical composition, molecular structure and explosive properties of primary explosives from the group of coordination compounds. a&nbsp;lot of attention was paid especially to the explosives that have already been used in initiating devices and those with unique properties, e.g. highly sensitive to laser radiation. To systematize the review, the title compounds were divided into groups which distinguishing feature was the kind of ligand.",

            "abstract": "In the last decades, sub- and supercritical water has received continuously increasing attention as a&nbsp;reaction medium. As safe, non-toxic, readily accessible it is used in chemical synthesis, waste destruction and biomass processing [1-4]. a&nbsp;broad area of technological and industrial applications of sub- and supercritical water arises from its physical and transport properties falling between those of a&nbsp;gas and a&nbsp;liquid. The solvent properties of water can rapidly change with increasing pressure and temperature [2, 5, 10]. Above the critical point (Tc = 647.1 K, Pc = 22.06 MPa) water becomes highly compressible and diffusive. The static dielectric constant approaches values characteristic for low-polar solvent (Fig. 5). Contrary to liquid water at ambient conditions, supercritical water is a&nbsp;poor solvent for ionic species but is well miscible with hydrocarbons and gases (Fig. 6). The ionic product of supercritical water can be a&nbsp;few orders of magnitude higher than in ambient water (Fig. 4) with consequent effect on the kinetics and mechanisms of chemical reactions. By adjustment of thermodynamic conditions one can tune density, viscosity, polarity or pH of water to the desired solvation properties without any change in the chemical composition. An alternation in the character of water solvent near and above the critical point is the consequence of the structural transformations in the hydrogen-bonded network. As evidenced by many experimental and simulation studies the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule and the lifetime of H-bonds decrease with increasing temperature and decreasing density [2, 10, 19]. With respect to experiment computer simulation plays an equal, and sometimes pivotal role, in quantitative characterization and understanding of water under extreme conditions. Precise definition of an H-bond employed in computer simulation allows one to examine size and topology of clusters of hydrogen-bonded molecules for various thermodynamic states [17, 19]. Such knowledge is invaluable to link features of the hydrogen bonding with the macroscopic properties of water [10, 19].\nThis article provides an overview of three aspects concerning water from ambient to supercritical conditions. In Chapter 1 the physical and transport properties are reviewed. Features of hydrogen bonding and a&nbsp;relationship between the molecular engagement in hydrogen-bonded clusters and macroscopic properties of water are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 focuses on technological and industrial applications of sub- and supercritical water. The summary concludes on main research needs.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide is a&nbsp;well known toxic gas that has recently been synthesized from the amino acids by the use of two enzymes (Fig. 1): cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase [1-3, 16, 17]. Hydrogen sulfide is a&nbsp;signaling molecule of the inflammatory and nervous systems, and in particular the cardiovascular system where it regulates vascular tone, cardiac work, and exerts cardioprotection [2, 3, 16, 17, 16-21, 29]. The endogenous metabolism and physiological functions of H2S position this gas well in the novel family of gasotransmitters together with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide.\nThis review summarizes the methods of hydrogen sulfide determination in biological samples. Biological tissue preparation procedures can include different steps: homogenization [7, 9, 10, 12, 19, 23-25, 29, 32-35], H2S release from tissues [9-14, 29], derivatization (Scheme 1-3) [1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 23-25, 29], and deproteinization [23-25, 30, 31, 33, 42, 43]. Finally analysis is possible by various methods, including spectrophotometry [6, 8, 11, 23-25, 34], high-performance liquid chromatography [6, 12-14, 29, 31, 41], gas chromatography [9-11, 27, 29, 32], potentiometry [22, 35, 36, 45] and polarography [19, 30]. However, there is much doubt about the reliability of the assay methods used. Determination of hydrogen sulfide is often hindered by numerous artifacts, as: the instability of sulfide, its high volatility, its great susceptibility to oxidation, its adherence to various materials (e.g. glass). This might lead to artificially elevated or lowered levels and explains the large discrepancy among the various reports.",

            "abstract": "Among the so called non-covalent interactions the hydrogen bond (H-bond) is probably the most frequently and the most thoroughly investigated. This is due to the fact that H-bond plays an essential role in many physical, chemical and biochemical processes. The strongest H-bonds are those assisted with additional effects, as for instance the resonance assisted H-bonds (RAHBs). The concept of RAHB was first proposed by Gilli and co-workers in 1989, and with the time it has become one of the most thoroughly investigated aspects from the field of structural chemistry. Originally, the definition of RAHB was directly connected with the resonance effect acting in RAHB motif (either intra- or intermolecular). Many scientists were exploring the phenomena of the RAHB. Thus, some controversies appeared in connection with the extra stabilization of the RAHB if comparing with its \"non-resonance-assisted\" counterparts. Some authors criticized the original explanation introduced by Gilli et al. and proposed alternative mechanism responsible for the relatively stronger H-bonding in the RAHB motifs. Since the resonance effect accompanying the formation of H-bridge in RAHBs is in fact a&nbsp;\u03c0-electron effect, it may interact with other \u03c0-electron effects acting in specific molecules, e.g. with substituent effect or aromatic \u03c0-electron delocalization. In this way the mutual interaction between different \u03c0-electron effects may occur, which may influence many physical and chemical properties of molecular systems under consideration, as for instance the strength of RAHB, local aromaticity, proton transfer barrier and many others.\nIn this paper a&nbsp;short review on the current state of knowledge on RAHB will be presented. The special attention will be paid onto the interrelation between RAHB and local aromaticity in derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

            "abstract": "The use of transition metal complexes of bridging multidentate ligands to construct predictable, self-assembled small inorganic systems and multi-dimensional infinite networks is an area of chemistry which has received ever-increasing attention over the recent years. Self-organization occurs usually from a&nbsp;mixture of components (organic ligands, salt crystals, and sometimes solvent molecules). The products exhibit a&nbsp;notable thermodynamic and kinetic stability and their components should contain all the information necessary for a&nbsp;correct assembly to occur [1-6]. Self-assembly has recently been studied in many types of organic and inorganic systems. This latter approach has proven particularly successful for the generation of a&nbsp;wide spectrum of architectural topologies such as for example, helicates [7-11], rotaxanes [12, 13], clusters [14-16], ladders [17-19], cages [20-22], grids [23-25] and molecular wheels [26-28], etc., based on ligand design and an application of suitable coordination geometries for the assembling system. The structure of supramolecular complexes depends strongly on the ligand substituent, the ligand conformation, the metal ion, the counterion, the solvent, and the reaction conditions [29-37]. Such compounds may exhibit novel physical and chemical properties with a&nbsp;potential use in supramolecular engineering, nanotechnology, biomedical inorganic chemistry, biological catalysis, and in the area of sensors [38-46].\nThe review has been prepared on the results of my own studies in the field [47-59] and focused on structural diversity and characterization of supramolecular complexes. The architectures of these compounds generated by self-assembly of polypirydyl ligands with d-and f-metal ions are fascinating and attractive because of their unusual properties and prospective implementation in many application [60-74].",

One of the most popular chemotherapeutic drugs that are currently in use are platinum compounds. Despite the success of cisplatin and other platinum-based anticancer compounds in cancer therapy [1, 2] there is still a&nbsp;need for new improved drugs with lower toxicity against healthy cells, better activity against tumor, less side effects, and without problems with drug resistance in primary and metastatic cancers [3, 4].\nOne of the most promising metals in the cancer treatment is ruthenium [6, 21, 22]. Ruthenium complexes appear generally less toxic than platinum-based complexes and show activity in cisplatin-resistant cells or in cells where cisplatin is inactive. In spite of development of promising ruthenium(II) compounds, in particular organometallics [50, 51], only ruthenium(III) complexes like (H2Im)[trans-Ru(DMSO)Cl4(HIm)], (NAMI-A) [62] (Ryc. 7a) and (HInd)[Ru(III)Cl4(Ind)2], (KP1019) [23] (Ryc. 7b) gain the phase II of clinical trials.\nThe complex NAMI-A showed marked efficacy against metastases whereas KP1019 was highly active against a&nbsp;colorectal tumor cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover the second compound is completely devoid of side effects and drug induced lethality at therapeutically relevant doses. Its therapeutic index is better than that of (HIm)[Ru(III)Cl4(Im)2]. The complex (HInd)[Ru(III)Cl4(Ind)2] has been shown to be efficiently taken up into the cells probably via interaction with transferrin. It induces apoptosis, but the cellular mechanisms of the apoptosis induction are still largely unknown [30].\nNon-cross-resistance in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells and reduced toxicity, which is in part due to the ability of ruthenium complexes to mimic the binding of iron to molecules of biological significance, exploiting the mechanisms that the body has evolved for non-toxic transport of iron, is a&nbsp;particularly attractive feature of ruthenium complexes [16]. In addition, some chemical properties, such as rate of ligand exchange, range of accessible oxidation states, and ability of ruthenium to mimic iron in binding to certain biological molecules make these compounds well suited for medicinal applications as an alternative to platinum antitumor drugs in the treatment of cancer cells resistant to cisplatin and its analogues justifying further development of this novel and interesting group of metal complexes [30].",

            "abstract": "Zinc is ubiquitous in living organisms and second only to iron among the transition metals. Catalytic zinc sites have been found in all six classes of enzymes. Liver alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1, LADH, Fig. 1) is a&nbsp;zinc enzyme, which catalyzes reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes utilizing as a&nbsp;co-substrate NAD+. The mechanism of an action of the enzyme is summarized by an equation:\nThe coordination of zinc in LADH is usually described as pseudotetrahedral but there were several findings supporting penta-coordination of zinc during the catalytic cycle (Fig. 1 and 2) [1-7].\nStudies on synthetic analogues of functional sites of the enzymes are used to elucidate the substrate - metal interactions [8]. Tri-tert-butoxysilanethiol which was used as a&nbsp;ligand to model cysteinate - metal ion centers has several advantageous features. It secures formation of mononuclear transition-metal complexes, exhibits resistance towards hydrolysis, and additionally its pKa value is close to that of cysteine mercapto group [9-11]. Over 20 tri-tert-butoxysilanethiolate complexes with MS2NO2 (M = transition metal) cores were synthesized to model the enzymatic centre of alcohol dehydrogenase, including complexes with water, methanol and ethanol (Fig. 5). Crystal structures of zinc(II), cobalt(II), cadmium(II), and manganese(II) complexes were determined and compared to the structures of LADH [12-17]. Structural features of zinc(II) and cadmium(II) complexes were analyzed (Fig. 9, Tab. 2) [15].\n113Cd CP/MAS NMR spectra of tri-tert-butoxysilanethiolate cadmium(II) complexes were determined and compared with the 113Cd NMR spectra of the cadmium-substituted alcohol dehydrogenase. Solid state 113Cd NMR shifts of five-coordinate cadmium(II) complexes with the CdNO2S2 coordination core were found to be identical to that of cadmium-substituted alcohol dehydrogenase in complex with NAD+ [15,18]. The equilibrium character of the reactions between bis(bis(tri-tert-butoxysilanethiolate) cadmium(II) and nitrogen ligands, with a&nbsp;low equilibrium constant of heteroleptic complex formation, were proved by 113Cd NMR studies in solution [18, 19].\nThe electronic absorption spectra of heteroleptic cobalt(II) complexes with tri-tert-butoxysilanethiolate and imidazole ligands were measured in methanol and solid state. The equilibrium reactions in the methanolic solutions of cobalt complexes were described on the basis of the analysis of charge transfer bands S\u2192dCo LMCT and the molecular structures of the obtained complexes [17]. EPR spectra revealed the high-spin configuration of the studied cobalt(II) compounds [17].\nQuantum mechanical calculations performed on the model zinc complex indicate ca 10-20% decrease in enthalpy of ethanol deprotonation due to complexation with Zn2+ [15].",

Biocatalysts have become a&nbsp;useful tool for organic chemists, allowing selective, one-step syntheses. Lipases, hydrolytic enzymes, have gained a&nbsp;considerable attention [1]. Lipase-catalyzed reaction proceeds according to the \"bi-bi ping-pong\" (Scheme 1) [16].\nCatalytic potential of lipases allows to obtain a&nbsp;wide range of organic compounds by formation of C-C, C-N, and C-S bonds [6-8]. Enzyme-catalyzed reactions depend on change of basic-acidic properties or redox potential and an application of appropriate solvent can increase the control over chemical balance.\nThe solvent used as the reaction medium should allow enzyme stability, increase its activity and selectivity. In organic hydrophobic solvents, enzyme is more stable and selective, its activity, however, is reduced in comparison to polar solvents [6-8]. During a&nbsp;search for optimal solvent special attention was paid to a&nbsp;typical organic solvents - ionic liquids.\nIonic liquids are organic salts (Scheme 2) [9-13]. They do not mix with hydrophobic solvents such as hexane (Tab. 2) [9, 12, 13, 23] and their polarity is similar to low molecular weight alcohols (Tab. 3) [9, 12, 13, 22, 23, 32]. Because of their specific physical properties, ionic liquids may be optimal microenvironment for enzymes, influencing their activity and stability.\nCALB is widely used in organic syntheses because of its adaptive capability (Tab. 1) as well as regio- and enantioselective properties [18-21]. Due to its exceptional conformation stability in ionic liquids, CALB can be successfully applied both in heterogeneous (Tab. 4) [22, 36] and homogeneous catalysis (Scheme 4, Tab. 5) [37]. The activity of CALB after incubation in ionic liquids is comparable or greater than in conventional organic solvents (Tab. 6, Fig. 1) [9, 13, 23, 38]. a&nbsp;solvent used as a&nbsp;reaction medium should help to maintain enzyme stabilizing its active conformation and protecting it from deactivating factors such as temperature and scCO<sub>2</sub> (Tab. 7) [38-43].\nSome ionic liquids constitute a&nbsp;bridge between conventional organic solvents and physiological enzyme environment. They provide exceptional activity of catalytic proteins, which allows efficient and selective reaction catalysis (Tab. 8) [6, 38-40, 43-61].",

The tremendous development in this field has led to development of many new variants of the aldol addition. There has been some success in the use of asymmetric catalysts, although they normally rely on a&nbsp;Mukaiyama-type process. This reaction required a&nbsp;conversion of a&nbsp;donor substrate into more reactive species such as enol silyl ether using not less than stoichiometric amounts of a&nbsp;silicon reagent and a&nbsp;base. From atom economic perspectives, such stoichiometric amounts of reagents should be excluded from the procedures. An exciting challenge in enhancement of the efficiency of the aldol reaction is to find a&nbsp;compound that will catalyze direct aldol addition without pre-formation of a&nbsp;nucleophile and to do so asymmetrically.\nDirect asymmetric aldol reaction, catalyzed by both metallic complexes and purely organic molecules now becomes one of the most desired tools in organic chemistry. After an initial period of validating methodology by using a&nbsp;wide range of important model reactions, the time has now been reached to address specific synthesis and solve pending problems of practical relevance. In this review we describe recently discovered, most important and most flexible catalysts for direct asymmetric aldol reaction and their application in total synthesis of target natural products and known compounds of biological and pharmaceutical relevance.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the food industry, the agricultural community and consumers have shown a&nbsp;growing interest in the so-called functional food [1-3]. Natural bioactive compounds in some dietary products are claimed to prevent various diseases such as inflammation, degenerative diseases and cancer [5]. This paper reviews molecular structures, nutritional importance and availability of natural bioactive compounds present in vegetable and fish oils.\nChapter 1 includes general description of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's), their physiological role and metabolism in mammalian organisms ([7-20], Schemes 1 and 2, Figs. 1 and 2). There is a&nbsp;link between dietary PUFA intake, inflammation and immunity. a&nbsp;composition of fatty acids in mammalian cells is sensitive to change in the fatty acids diet. The n-6 PUFA's are the precursors of prostaglandines and related compounds, which play an important role in inflammation and in regulation of immunity. On the contrary, the n-3 PUFA's abundant in fish oils and also present in some plant seed oils have anti-inflammatory properties and are therapeutically useful in several diseases. DHA from this family may also exert beneficial effects on development of the nervous system. Irrespective of PUFA's, vegetable oils contain a&nbsp;variety of bioactive compounds, mainly lipid-soluble antioxidants. This class of antioxidants includes vitamin E ([21-37], Figs. 3 and 4), which is a&nbsp;generic term that constitutes a&nbsp;group of structurally related compounds comprising of tocopherols and tocotrienols. a&nbsp;presence of the phenolic hydroxyl group in these compounds is critical for their antioxidant activity and enables to scavenge free-radical species both in vitro and in vivo. Other bioactive compounds present in vegetable oils are plant lignans ( [38-64], Fig. 5). In a&nbsp;human body, the plant lignans are converted to the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone. In the literature cited, lignans are discussed as anticancer agents, especially against breast and prostate cancer. Apart from a&nbsp;weak estrogenic properties, their anticancer activity may be supported on the antioxidation capacity.\nVegetable oils are also a&nbsp;good source of phytosterols ([65-80], Figs. 6 and 7). Despite their similar chemical structures, phytosterols and cholesterol differ markedly from each other in regard to their pharmacological characteristics including intestinal absorption and further metabolism. Phytosterols produce a&nbsp;wide spectrum of therapeutic effects in the human organism including anti-tumor properties.\nIn addition, another compounds present in edible oils are described, e.g. carotens and coenzyme Q10, all of which have potent biological activity, and exert beneficial effects in regard to cardiovascular and cancer diseases ([81-101], Fig. 8).\nThe majority of the bibliography included in the present review is selected from that published since 2000 by the year 2009.",

            "abstract": "Possible ways of utilization of waste chloroorganic compounds have been presented. The methods like isomerization, hydrodechlorination, ammonolysis and chlorolysis have been described. Practical application of these methods allows the management of chloroorganic wastes coming from waste water and waste streams formed e.g. in the production of vinyl chloride by dichloroethane method [2] and in the production of propylene oxide by chlorohydrin method [1]. Four valuable methods of chlorocompounds utilization have been discussed. The first one is isomerization of 1,1,2-trichloroethane [3, 4] to 1,1,1-trichloroethane as the valuable product with a&nbsp;less toxicity than the substrate. The second method is ammonolysis of waste 1,2-dichloropropane and 1,2,3-trichloropropane. Third described method is hydrodechlorination [5, 6] of chloroorganic compounds, especially used for reduction of chlorophenols, vinyl chloride and 1,2-dichloroethan. The last discussed method is the chlorolysis [1, 7]. This method can be used for utilization of all types of waste chloroorganics. Separation of waste chloroorganic compounds by adsorption methods [8-11] has also been described in the article.",

Nature has perfected the stereospecific aldol reaction by using aldolase enzymes. While virtually all the biochemical aldol reactions use unmodified donor and acceptor carbonyls and take place under catalytic control in an aqueous environment, the chemical domain of the aldol addition has mostly relied on prior transformation of carbonyl substrates, and the whole process traditionally is carried out in anhydrous solvents. The area of asymmetric aldol reactions in water has received much attention recently in light of the perception of both its green chemistry advantages and its analogy to eon-perfected enzyme catalysis. Only recently catalytic asymmetric reactions promoted by water-compatible Lewis acids with chiral ligands have been developed; most Lewis acids are not stable in water. Seminal work by List, Lerner, and Barbas on the intermolecular proline-catalyzed direct asymmetric aldol reaction opened a&nbsp;new platform for designing metal-free asymmetric catalysts, although their application was initially limited to organic solvents. Most recently, the challenge of developing efficient aqueous-phase organocatalytic processes has also been tackled. Recent progress in the area initiated constructive discussion on the role and practical merits of water as a&nbsp;solvent. This article describes recent developments in this area.",

The following publication is a&nbsp;review of currently used biologically active peptides applied in cosmetic products for skin aging (Tab. 1). There are three main groups of peptides with different mechanism of action: neurotransmitter-affecting peptides, carrier peptides and signal peptides [16]. Neuropeptides are peptides, which mimic the action of botulinum neurotoxin (the structure of active toxin is presented in the Fig. 1). These peptides decrease muscle contraction through interactions at the neuromuscular junction [13, 16, 18]. Carrier peptides take part in delivering a&nbsp;cofactor required for wound healing and enzymatic processes into the dermis [16, 28, 29]. Instead, signal peptides are able to stimulate collagen synthesis and cause growth of human dermal skin fibroblasts [16, 18].",

            "abstract": "Molecular self-assembly offers unique opportunity for the fabrication of novel supramolecular structures and advanced materials. The inspiration for the development of such structures is often resulting from self-assembling modules in biology, as natural systems always form complex structures from relatively simple building blocks [1, 2]. Several studies had demonstrated the versatility of peptide to form well organized assemblies. This includes cyclic peptides designed with alternating D- and L-amino acids, amphiphile peptides, peptide-conjugates and ionic self-complementary peptides. The 37-residue amylin (Fig. 5), also known as islet amyloid polypeptide, forms fibrils that are the main component of amyloid that develops in the pancreas of type 2 diabetes patients. Amylin also in vitro readily forms amyloid fibrils that are highly polymorphic under typical experimental conditions [21-33]. The molecular structure of amylin protofilaments in striated ribbons closely resembles the protofilament in amyloid fibrils with a&nbsp;similar morphology formed by the 40-residue beta-amyloid peptide that is associated with Alzheimer's disease [48-54]. But not only amylin is a&nbsp;self-assembling peptide. We can also find another examples in biological proteins and peptides that have the intrinsic ability to self-assemble into elongated solid nanofibrils, which may give rise to amyloid diseases or alternatively, inspire applications ranging from tissue engineering to nanoelectronics (Fig. 4). Proteinaceous fibrils are extensively studied searching for detailed theoretical models explaining the mechanism of formation, morphology and properties of self-assembled structures. Especially intriguing state of protein-like self-assemblies are nanotubes (NTs), defined as an elongated nano-object with a&nbsp;definite inner hole. In contrast to proteinaceous fibrils, nanotubes are much less frequently observed and far less well understood. However, they have attracted research interest as key components for nanotechnology (Fig. 13). The simplest objects prone to self-assembly are aromatic dipeptides diphenylalanine, diphenylglycine, and their simple derivatives form nanotubes or spherical nanometric assemblies. Remarkable flexibilities of peptides fragments in formation of nanostructures recently have been considered important for many applications in various fields including molecular electronics, tissue engineering, and material science [87-92].",

It has been found that the presence of \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acid residues exhibit a&nbsp;pronounced helix-inducing potential which is responsible for a&nbsp;membrane destabilisation exerted by peptaibols [1]. Moreover, peptides containing \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acid residues were found to exhibit enhanced resistance against chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis [2, 3], and acting as enzyme inhibitors, by mimicking ligand properties of their natural analogues, but preventing subsequent enzymatic reaction [6]. The increasing interest in the proprieties of \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acids stimulates the search for new, effective methods of their synthesis. Among many methods of synthesis of \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acids some can undeniably be regarded as classic approaches in asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acids such as the bislactim ether method proposed by Sch\u00f6llkopf [25-35]. The others include the self-reproduction of stereogenic centre (the SRS method) discovered by Seebach [9-15] and developed by O'Donnel and the method of alkylation of benzofenone imine in the presence of chiral phase transfer catalysts [55, 56].\nDepend on a&nbsp;character of bond which is created in asymmetric process all approaches to asymmetric synthesis of \u03b1\u03b1-disubstituted \u03b1-amino acids can be divide into three categories. First of them is based on an introduction of alkyl substituents at the \u03b1 carbon atom. This approach can involve electrophilic alkylation of enolates, nucleophilic alkylation of C=N double bond, Mannich reaction etc. Second approach involves an introduction of \u03b1-amine group [70-78]. The last approach is based on an substitutionat \u03b1 carbon atom of carboxylic function [82-95]. Another less general approaches consist of utilization of indirect methods including rearrangements or ring-opening reactions [100-112].",

This amino acid in mammalian collagen is located only in the repeating sequence Gly-3-Hyp-4-Hyp [5] but its frequency is extremely low. Hydroxylation of prolyl residue to 3-Hyp 3 in collagen is catalyzed by prolyl-3-hydroxylase [6, 9]. It was proved that 4(R)-Hyp 2 greatly enhance the conformational stability of the collagen triple helix in contrast with 3(S)-Hyp 3, which destabilizing effect has been extensively investigated [7, 11, 12, 15].\nThe 3-hydroxyproline is also present in the invertebrates in the Fasciola hepatica [21].\nThe compounds 3 and/or 4 have been found in some peptide antibiotics: Telomycin 5, Plusbacin A3 6, Tripropeptins 7, Cyclothialidine 8 and in the antifungal drugs: Caspofungin 9 and Pneumocandin 10 [22-29].

            "abstract": "A reaction catalyzed by glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (L-glutamine: D-fructose-phosphate amidotransferase, Glms) is the first step committed to the amino-sugar biosynthetic pathway of all living organisms [1]. This is in particular the only endogeneous access to hexosamines which are absolutely required in the edification of microbial cell walls.\nGlucosamine-6-phosphate synthase was proposed as a&nbsp;target for antifungal chemotherapy and a&nbsp;search for its selective inhibitors as potential antifungals has been continued [2].\nThis enzyme catalyzes two coupled enzymatic reactions. The first is the hydrolysis of glutamine to yield glutamate and nascent ammonia, which is transferred to Fru-6-P. The second reaction is the isomerization of Fru-6-P to an aldose, corresponding to Heyns rearrangement (3, 4). Like other amidotransferases, GlmS is organized into two domains: the NH2-terminal glutamine amidotransferase domain, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine, and the COOH-terminal synthase domain, which catalyzes the isomerization (5-8). The glutamine hydrolysis reaction has been studied extensively and utilises the NH2-terminal cysteine thiol, which forms a&nbsp;g-glutamyl thioester intermediate during the reaction. This catalytic role was confirmed by conversion of the NH2-terminal cysteine to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis which abolished enzymatic activity [2].\nThe already known specific inhibitors of GlcN-6-P synthase belong to two different structural groups: L-glutamine mimics and analogues of the putative transition state intermediates. In general, glutamine amidotransferases are inactivated by glutamine afinity analogues such as 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and 6-chloro-5-oxo-L-norleucine (chloroketone), which alkylate the essential cysteine residue (5, 6, 9). Indeed, many of the active site-directed irreversible inactivators developed for GlmS contain an electrophilic function at the ?-position of glutamate and react irreversibly with the NH2-terminal cysteine residue. More recently, attempts to develop carbohydrate-based inhibitors have been made with the hope of developing higher specificity (10-13).\nThe second group of compounds comprises derivatives of phosphorylated aminosugars, including: 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucitol-6-phosphate (ADGP), arabinose-5-phosphate oxime and 5-methylenephosphono-D-arabinohydroximolactone, as the most powerful GlcN-6-P synthase inhibitors [11-15]. These compounds exhibit a&nbsp;very poor, if any, antifungal activity.\nThis paper describes the inhibition of GlmS by several analogues of the cis-enolamine intermediate in an attempt to probe the structural requirements for potent inhibition of this enzyme. The energetic contribution of the 2-amino group to binding of the product and the cis-enolamine intermediate is determined.",

            "abstract": "Surfactants (ionic and nonionic compounds, Fig. 1) have specific properties and they are applied in various areas of human activity (Tab. 2). The most important properties of surfactants are: amphiphilicity (Fig. 3), solubility in liquids of different polarity, formation of micellar structures (Fig. 4), adsorption and absorption in various media, toxicity (Tab. 1) [12-23] and susceptibility to degradation.\nThe widely used various types of surfactants contribute to emission of pollutants to the environment (Fig. 6) [32-40]. So it is necessary to monitor their presence in ecosystems (also products of their incomplete degradation) and thus, the development of analytical methodologies, which allow for quick determination of many surfactants at low levels is needed.\nTherefore environmental samples have to be prepared for analysis using techniques of isolation and enrichment of analytes (usually LLE, ASE, SPE) [41-56]. For quantitative and qualitative determination of the analytes in extracts following analytical techniques are used: spectrophotometry, tensammetry, chromatography, capillary electrophoresis [57-78].\nIn the literature one can find information about determination of surfactants in different environmental samples. There is data available about levels of surfactants (especially anionic and nonionic) in solid (sediments and sludges, soil, street dust) and liquid samples (surface water and groundwater, wastewater, atmospheric deposits) (Tab. 3) [79-91].",

            "abstract": "Optically active unnatural amino acids play important roles in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry [1]. Thus, development of novel methods for the synthesis of these amino acids is of great interest for organic chemists. Incorporation of these building blocks often results in peptidomimetics with limited conformational flexibility, enhanced enzymatic stability, improved pharmacodynamics and bioavailability. This review summarizes the utilization of \u03b2-lactones of serine and of \u03b1-alkylserines in the enantioselective synthesis of \u03b2-substituted alanines. N-Protected \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b1-amino acids can be cyclized under modified Mitsunobu conditions to \u03b2-lactones [2-19]. Serine and threonine \u03b2-lactones can be also obtained by carboxyl group activation using coupling reagents (DIC, TBTU, HBTU, BOP, PyBOP, HBTU) [16, 21-27]. Readily accessible \u03b2-lactone ring opening with various nucleophiles provides many unnatural amino acids and other chiral building blocks. In the first part, the synthesis of N-protected \u03b2-hydroxyamino acid \u03b2-lactones and the ring opening mechanism are discussed [30, 31]. The second part of this review describes the ring opening with various nucleophiles, including halogens, thiols, selenes and tellures, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon nucleophiles.\nReactions of N-protected \u03b2-hydroxyamino acid and \u03b1-alkylserines \u03b2-lactones with halogen nucleophiles (HCl, HBr, LiCl, and MgX2) in all described cases yield \u03b1-halogenomethyl derivatives [2, 20, 25, 32, 33]. \u03b1-Halogenomethyl-\u03b1-amino acids are potential enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors of parent amino acid decarboxylases. Only a&nbsp;few synthetic strategies directed towards the synthesis of the selected \u03b1-halogenomethylamino acids have been described. The difficulty associated with the synthesis of these molecules lies in the presence of a&nbsp;halogen atom on the carbon atom vicinal to quaternary center bearing amine and carboxylic acid functionalities (like the neopenthyl position). Sulphur, selenium and tellurium nucleophiles were used to obtain S-substituted cysteines, \u03b1-alkylcysteines and lanthionine derivatives and their seleno and telluro analogues [2, 28, 32, 33, 44, 45, 49-54]. The use of nitrogen nucleophiles leads to \u03b2-amino-, \u03b2-cyano-?and \u03b2-azidoalanines [2, 11, 13-15, 32, 33, 55-71]. Properties of the nucleofile and of \u03b2-lactone determine regioselectivity of ring opening, giving \u03b2-aminoalanines or amides. The use of sodium azide as the nucleophile led to the formation of \u03b2-azidoalanine and \u03b2-azido-\u03b1-alkylalanines, useful building blocks in peptide synthesis and precursors of \u03b1,\u03b2-diamino acids. Among nitrogen nucleophiles the cyclic secondary amine (pyrolidine, morpholine), aromatic amines and heterobases were used to synthesize \u03b2-aminoalanine derivatives. The \u03b2-lactone ring openings were carried out with phosphorus [10, 18, 72, 73] and carbon nucleophiles [5, 74-76].\nSerine, threonine and \u03b1-alkylserines \u03b2-lactones are widely used intermediates for the synthesis of new optically pure unnatural, multifunctional amino acids, which are difficult to obtain in other ways.",

            "abstract": "Selenospinels with general formula ACr2Se4 (A = Zn, Cu, Cd) were doped with nickel and tin ions. The chemical synthesis was carried out based on solid phase reactions. To estimate the chemical composition of the mono- and polycrystalline compounds, the following methods were applied: JEOL scanning microscope and ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry). For the obtained polycrystalline compounds, their structural parameters were defined using X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld method. Definition of structure of the monocrystals was carried out using KM4 four-circle diffractometer and SHELX software. Magnetic properties were investigated with strong stationary magnetic fields up to 14 T in the temperature range of 4.2\u00f7300 K using an induction magnetometer and with stationary magnetic fields up to 0.5 T in the temperature range of 1.8\u00f7300 K using a&nbsp;SQUID superconducting magnetometer.\nIn the systems doped with nickel, depending on the reaction stoichiometry, nickel ions were directed to tetrahedral or octahedral positions. When the octahedral positions are fully occupied by chromium ions, small amounts of nickel directed to tetrahedral positions are able to occupy them. The increasing amount of Ni2+ ions tends to occupy the octahedral positions in accordance with preference energy, leading to change in structure from cubic to monoclinic one [19, 37, 38]. Nickel ions present in the spinel crystal lattice influence the magnetic properties of these compounds. For ZnCr2-xNixSe4 system, an increase in values of effective magnetic moment and saturation magnetic moment accompanying the increase in nickel ions concentration was ascertained. It was caused by the presence of another magnetic ions in ZnCr2Se4 crystal lattice. The values of paramagnetic Curie-Weiss point and N\u00e9el point decrease with the increase in nickel concentration. It is associated with an increase in antiferromagnetic interactions in the system caused by nickel ions [39-41]. Like in the Cd1-xNixCr2Se4 system, saturation magnetic moment does not depend on the amount of nickel built-in, and the crystals exhibit strong ferromagnetic interactions. Lack of a&nbsp;change in saturation indicates that nickel is built in with compensated magnetic moment, or in a&nbsp;low-spin state (S = 0). Cadmium and nickel ions occupy tetrahedral positions and chromium ions - octahedral ones [42].\nIn the systems doped with tin, the reactions carried out in the solid phase were aimed to build in tin ions in tetra- and octahedral positions. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the presence of tin ions in selected chromites. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy applied for the complex system Zn1-xSnxCr2Se4 confirmed the presence of tin ions in two inequivalent positions: in tetrahedral and in octahedral environments. Based on theses considerations, the general formula of these compounds may be as follows: ZnxSn\u03b4CrySn\u03b7Se4, where \u03b4 - parameter describing the share of tin ions in tetrahedral sublattice, \u03b7 - parameter describing the share of tin ions in octahedral sublattice [43]. Although tin ions does not contribute to a&nbsp;magnetic share, their presence in the crystal lattice promotes an increase in antiferromagnetic interactions\nin the studied compounds. Under the influence of tin ions, conductance changes from p-type (hole conduction) occurring in pure ZnCr2Se4 to n-type (electron conduction) [44, 45]. In CuCr2-xSnxSe4 system, magnetic properties change from ferromagnetic for nominal value x = 0.2 to antiferromagnetic for nominal value x = 1.0. These changes are caused by the presence of Sn4+ ions in the system, generating Cr<sup>2+</sup> ions. The observed change in structure is caused by Jahn-Teller effect, occurring in the presence of Cu2+ and Cr2+ ions [46].",

            "abstract": "Silica-metal nanostructures consisting of siliceous cores and metal nanoshells attract recently a&nbsp;lot of attention because of their unique properties, mainly catalytic and spectroscopic. The core of these nanostructures is coated with a&nbsp;thin layer (nanoshell) of another material, often being a&nbsp;noble metal, of a&nbsp;thickness between 1 and 20 nm. The silica-metal nanostructures are highly functional materials of properties different from those of the siliceous core and the metal nanoshell. Already nowadays these nanostructures have found various applications such as for an exaltation of chemical stability of colloids, for an enhancement of luminescence properties of materials, for biosensing, drug delivery and other medical applications.\nThe main goal of this two-part review is the presentation of various methods for the preparation of silica-metal nanostructures, description of the most important physicochemical properties of these materials, and presentation of their potential applications. The first part is focused on the main preparation methods of silica particles being used as cores for the aforementioned core-shell nanostructures and methods for their surface modification.\nA special emphasis is given on the St\u00f6ber method, which is relatively simple, effective and well verified for the synthesis of large silica particles (with diameters from 100 nm to several microns). a&nbsp;typical preparation of silica particles is based on mixing ethanol, ammonia (as a&nbsp;catalyst), and often small amount of water, followed by rapid or gradual addition of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under vigorous stirring. This article reviews numerous studies reporting the effects of various factors on the structural properties of silica particles, especially the steps required for controlling their size, assuring narrow particle size distribution and high uniformity of the resulting particles.\nThe surface chemistry of siliceous cores is essential in the process of metal nanoshells formation. Therefore, in this work the main methods for modification of the silica surface are presented in details in order to prepare this surface for the formation of metal nanoshells. This modification is often based on the replacement of silanols with specific organic groups (often aminopropyl and mercaptopropyl groups), which interact strongly with metal nanoparticles. In 1998 Halas and co-workers elaborated a&nbsp;simple method for the preparation of core-shell nanostructures involving attachment of specific organic groups to the silica surface followed by deposition of gold nanoparticles and subsequent reduction of tetrachloroauric acid in order to obtain continuous gold nanoshells. The first modifier of the silica surface was 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Later, several other modifiers have been tested. The aforementioned modification of the silica surface can be single- or two-step process. The single-step process involves hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS in the presence of functional organosilane, which results in silica particles with desired organic groups attached. The two-step process involves the synthesis of silica particles in the first step and their surface modification with organosilanes in the second step. The presented literature survey shows that the proper modification of the surface of silica particles is a&nbsp;necessary condition for the formation of uniform metal nanoshells.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade the silica-metal nanostructures consisting of siliceous cores and metallic nanoshells have been intensively studied. The second part of this review article presents recent advances in the synthesis, characterization and application of silica-gold core-shell nanostructures. a&nbsp;special emphasis is given to the nanostructures composed of the silica core and gold or silver nanoshell.\nNowadays gold is often used metal for the formation of nanoshells. The reason for this interest is a&nbsp;great application potential of SiO2-Au nanostructures in catalysis, chemical and biological detection of various substances, optoelectronics, photonic crystals, plasmonics, and in analytical techniques utilizing surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Silver nanoshells formed on siliceous cores show similar properties as those of gold nanoshells. Silica-gold nanostructures can be prepared using various methods, for instance, by growing up gold nanoshells on the siliceous cores with deposited gold nanoparticles, by precipitating gold nanoparticles with their simultaneous deposition on modified silica cores, by reducing gold ions on Sn-modified silica particles, or by forming gold nanoshells under ultrasonic conditions.\nThis article presents several methods for the formation of silica-metal nanostructures. a&nbsp;special emphasis is given to the method of growing up gold nanoshell on the modified silica core with deposited gold nanoparticles. This method assures a&nbsp;good control of the nanoshell thickness as well as its surface properties. In this method the organically modified silica particles are initially covered with gold nanoparticles, which facilitate a&nbsp;further growth of gold nanoshell by reduction of tetrachloroauric acid with agents such as formaldehyde. In the case of aminopropyl-modified silica particles, about 25-30% coverage of the silica surface with gold nanoparticles can be achieved. The effect of other than aminopropyl organic groups on the coverage of the silica surface with gold nanoparticles was studied showing that amino and mercaptopropyl groups assure about 30% surface coverage with gold, while this coverage is very small when methyl and diphenylphospine groups are on the silica surface.\nThe aforementioned reduction of gold ions and growth of gold nanoparticles depend on the uniformity of the initial coverage of the silica surface with gold nanoparticles, the concentration of reduced gold ions as well as the nature and the concentration of reducing agent. The most often used reducing agents are formaldehyde and sodium borohydride, although hydroxylamine hydrochloride, carbon monoxide, hydrogen peroxide and trisodium citrate are also used. Silver is the next popular metal after gold used for the formation of nanoshells. The other metal used are platinum, palladium, nickel and copper.\nThe final sections of this review are devoted to a&nbsp;brief presentation of various techniques used for characterization of core-shell nanostructures as well as to their applications. The most often used methods include scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy, wavelength (WDS) and energy (EDS, EDX) dispersion spectroscopy, photoacoustic spectoscopy (PAS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimery (TG) and adsorption (ADS).\nAs regards applications of silica-metal core-shell nanostructures, the prospects are enormous ranging from catalysis, optoelectronics, to drug delivery, and other medical applications.",

Although the enzyme is also present in mammalian systems, substantial difference in physiological consequences of GlcN-6-P synthase inhibition in fungi and in mammals, constitute a&nbsp;firm molecular basis for the selective toxicity of specific enzyme inhibitors. The enzyme was proposed as a&nbsp;target for antifungal chemotherapy and a&nbsp;search for its selective inhibitors as potential antifungals has been continued. So far, two main groups of such compounds were identified: L-glutamine analogs and mimics of a&nbsp;putative cis-enolamine transition state intermediate but none of them demonstrated high antifungal activity, due to the inefficient uptake by the fungal cells. Among a&nbsp;number of known glutamine analogues some are selective inhibitors of GlcN-6-P synthase, not interacting with other enzymes utilising L-glutamine as substrate. One of them, N3-(4-methoxyfumaroyl)-l-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (FMDP), gave rise to oligopeptidic compounds demonstrating remarkable antifungal activity [2]. Incorporation of FMDP into peptide structure allowed effective internalisation of the enzyme inhibitor by the way of peptide permeases, but on the other hand was a&nbsp;reason of substantial specific resistance, since peptides permeases are not essential for fungal cells [3, 4].\nThe second group of compounds comprises derivatives of phosphorylated aminosugars, including: 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucitol-6-phosphate (ADGP), arabinose-5--phosphate oxime and 5-methylenephosphono-D-arabinohydroximolactone, as the most powerful GlcN-6-P synthase inhibitors [5-7].

These free radicals initiate reactions with DNA or RNA molecules and then can lead to changes in the genome sequence. These mutations are most probably responsible for a&nbsp;number of different diseases (involving a&nbsp;change in the genome sequence) or, at least, can accompany them.\nReactive oxygen species and more specifically - hydroxyl radical can react with DNA molecules and lead to changes in their structures. Formation of radicals at C5' and C8 atoms of 2'-deoxyadenosine leads, through intramolecular cyclisation, to 5',8-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA) derivatives.\nFrequency of DNA damage occurrence surges with an increase of an ionizing radiation dose. Different repair systems are however present in cellular machinery: BER, which exploits glycosylase and NER - a&nbsp;more complex process involving the removal of damaged oligonucleotides. The later is the basic mechanism for removal the 5',6-cyclo-2'-deoxynucleosides and 5',8-cyclo-2'-deoxynucleosides like cdA. Their defective activity may be responsible for many types of diseases, such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, chronic hepatitis, HCV, atopic dermatitis and different types of cancer.\nThe mechanistic, structural and biochemical studies presented in this work produce quite clear answer as to the approximate range level of the (5'R)-cdA and (5'S)-cdA accumulation in the genome after the lesion period.\nUsing quantum chemistry methods (DFT) paths of the cyclisation reaction have been determined. From the structural analysis point of view, it has been demonstrated that the covalent bond between C(5') and C(8) in nucleoside induces an unusual West conformation of the furanose ring. Based on the NMR data analysis it can be postulated that the rigid and fixed structure of cdA can strongly influence the global geometry of oligonucleosides. Moreover, using the quantum mechanic study of double strand DNA it has been demonstrated that the presence of (5'S)-cdA provokes a&nbsp;\"domino effect\" extending towards the 5'-end of the strand with this lesion. No domino effect is observed for the 3'-end. The obtained biological results indicate that the presence of (5'S)-cdA in the complementary strand to the strand under repair on the 5'-end side is the critical factor for the inhibition of the BER process of DNA.",

            "abstract": "Skin is the coating of all human and animal organisms. It is a&nbsp;kind of space where different processes take place. Skin is the largest and the heaviest organ in the body. Also, it is a&nbsp;barrier, that stops water and the part of body, which should be particularly protected [1]. The skin is composed of three main layers: epidermis (Fig. 1), dermis (Fig. 3) and subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 5). Each of these layers has completely different role and is characterized by various properties.\nEpidermis is the outermost layer of skin. It consists of a&nbsp;living and a&nbsp;dead zone. The living area forms new cells which are the subject to further changes, while in the zone of dead cells they are highly flattened and devoid of nuclei [2]. In the epidermis, exactly in the reproductive output layer there are melanocytes, which are cells responsible for production of the pigment - melanin (Fig. 2). Melanin is responsible for color of hair, eyes and skin. It is formed from tyrosine as a&nbsp;result of numerous biochemical reactions [3]. Biological activity of melanin is determined by the presence of appropriate peptide. The sequences of its active components are: Ser-Tyr, Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg, and Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val.\nIt is possible to protect the skin also against the solar radiation. The hormone MSH absorbs and reflects UV radiation. Under the influence of UV radiation the amount of melanin increases, causing temporary changes in skin color [3].\nUnder the epidermis there is a&nbsp;proper skin, which is composed of elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and the basic substance, which fuses the fiber elements. The elastic fibers are scattered among collagen fibers. Proper skin is the place where a&nbsp;valuable protein - very important in cosmetics - occurs - the native collagen. It is the main protein of connective tissue. Collagen has a&nbsp;very high tensile strength and is a&nbsp;major component of tendons. It is responsible for skin elasticity. Loss of collagen from the skin causes wrinkles [4].\nA distinctive layer of skin is the subcutaneous tissue. It combines dermis with muscles. It is composed of fat cells separated by connective tissue. The size and the shape of fat cells vary depending on gender, diet and also age [5].\nSkin, like other authorities is aging. These process may be accelerated or delayed under the influence of various endogenous and exogenous elements (Tab. 1). Also genetic predisposition are of significant importance. It seems that, as soon as we age, we inherit from our ancestors. To delay the aging process, it is necessary to properly take care of and protect the skin. There are many ways to delay aging of the skin. The most successful, for example cosmetics with active ingredients such as peptides, will be presented here.\n",

            "abstract": "The Mitsunobu reaction provides an extremely useful and versatile synthetic route for a&nbsp;large array of products involving formation of a&nbsp;new C-O, C-N, C-S, C-X, or C-C bond. The reaction is a&nbsp;dehydrative coupling of an alcohol with an acid/pronucleophile using a&nbsp;combination of an oxidizing azo reagent and a&nbsp;reducing phosphine reagent - equation (1). The reaction is very popular due to its stereoselectivity and compatibility with a&nbsp;wide range of functional groups. However, the use of this method is complicated by the resulting complex reaction mixtures containing a&nbsp;product, triphenylphosphine oxide and the reduced azodicarboxylate, as well as unreacted starting material.\nDue to omnipresence of the Mitsunobu reaction, it was a&nbsp;subject of numerous reviews [1-12]. The mechanism and the stereochemical result of the reaction are still thoroughly studied [22-38] and the current, generally accepted mechanism is outlined in Scheme 1.\nThis article provides an overview of the separation-friendly strategies introduced to facilitate product isolation in the Mitsunobu reaction and its modified and alternative mediators. As two comprehensive reviews devoted to modified Mitsunobu reagents and separation techniques facilitating isolation of the condensation product appeared fairly recently [7, 8], this work concentrates on examples of isolation-friendly strategies and studies subsequent to mentioned reviews.\nSeparation facilitating strategies are based on tagging one of Mitsunobu reagents or substrates with a&nbsp;\"separation tag\" (phase tag, affinity tag), which controls the behaviour of the component and allows to separate the tagged reaction component from untagged ones.\nThere are four main separation techniques used in the Mitsunobu reaction: polymer-assisted phase-switching or solid phase immobilization (2.1.1.), acidic/basic aqueous work-up (2.1.2.), fluorous approach (2.1.3.), and post-reaction sequestration.\nBoth phosphine and azodicarboxylate can be attached to insoluble polymer and the derived side-products (phosphine oxide or hydrazodicarboxylate) can be removed by filtration at the end of the reaction.\nFluorous tagging makes possible the separation of a&nbsp;fluorous compound from non-fluorous ones either by partitioning between a&nbsp;fluorous and an organic liquid or by fluorous solid-phase extraction (FSPE) - Scheme 6. a&nbsp;fluorous-tagged acid was also applied to achieve inversion of an alcohol configuration (Scheme 8).\nAnother separation-facilitating strategy uses polymerizable Mitsunobu reagents and post-reaction sequestration, e.g. by ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), either of a&nbsp;condensation product (Scheme 9), or side products (impurity anihilation).\nThe scope of the Mitsunobu reaction was greatly widened by introduction of alternative Mitsunobu reagents by the Tsunoda-It\u00f4 group [69-79]. Some of these reagents (1-4, Scheme 12) mediate C-alkylation reactions of very weak acids (pKa > 23) [77, 78]. Several other modified Mitsunobu reagents are also described.",

            "abstract": "The electro-optical Kerr effect finds wide application in conformational analysis of molecules and molecular aggregates [1-5], particularly in cases where the standard X-ray and NMR techniques cannot be used. For instance, NMR allows to establish conformations of linear and cyclic unsaturated organic compounds. However, it is less effective in an analysis of molecular complexes, particularly of those that have several rotational symmetry axes. In such cases a&nbsp;combination of techniques based on molecular dipole moments, electro-optical Kerr effect, optical Kerr effect, IR spectroscopy, and Rayleigh scattering can be applied [6]. The foundations of conformational analysis of molecular complexes using several complementary physical approaches are developed in Ref. [7].\nThe electro-optical methods are particularly useful for an investigation of intramolecular interactions [8-18]. The strength, direction and other details of intramolecular interactions can be determined by analyzing the deviations of the experimental molar Kerr constant (mK) from its value calculated according to the tensor-additive scheme that operates with polarizability tensors of molecular cores and functional groups [19, 20]. For instance, using this approach it has been shown that weakening of conjugation in an electron donor-acceptor chain can lead to flattening of the molecular structure [21].\nThe Kerr constant is also very sensitive to intermolecular interactions [22-29]. In order to assess quantitatively an extent of the solvent effect on the mK values, both molecular and continuum models of solution structure have been used [30, 31]. The mK values are greatly affected by the mutual orientation of solvent and solute molecules, which interact by dispersive, inductive and dipole-dipole forces [32]. Hydrogen and donor-acceptor bonding have an even stronger influence on the mK values [33]. The equimolar mixtures approach developed in Ref. [34] allows to determine the molar Kerr constant (mK), dipole moment (m), equilibrium constant (K) and, ultimately, structure of a&nbsp;molecular complex based on measurements of the Kerr constant (B), dielectric permittivity (e), density (d) and refractive index (n) of a&nbsp;series of dilute solutions of the complex.\nFuture trends in the development of the electro-optical methods in chemistry are discussed. Theories that relate the electric-optic proprieties of molecules with their reactivity are particularly important. Such theories should be able to predict the changes in the polarizabilities and dipole moments of bonds, molecules and molecular aggregates during the course of chemical reactions.\n",

            "abstract": "Transplantology is getting more and more important in medicine. Development of surgical techniques and immunosuppressive treatment enabled to establish successful transplantations with various organs and tissues. However, allografts are recognized as foreign tissues and stimulate rejection, i.e. a&nbsp;strong immunological response which, if not stopped, results in complete destruction of the transplanted tissue. In order to prevent the rejection patients have to be treated with immunosuppressive drugs after transplantation. Unfortunately, such a&nbsp;damping of immune system poses a&nbsp;risk of cancer or severe infections. The treatment itself is also toxic, notably when applied in a&nbsp;long-term maintenance therapy. Currently, adverse effects of immunosuppressive drugs are recognized as the ones to be involved significantly in chronic rejection and limitation of long survival of grafted tissues. Whereas prevention of acute rejection is mostly successful, there is still no efficient treatment for chronic graft rejection. Reduction of a&nbsp;dose of immunosuppressive drugs or an invention of new active substances is considered the most promising solution.\nNowadays, immunosuppressive drugs can be divided into the three main groups: agents which inhibit production of cytokines taking part in cells' activation (glicocorticosteroids, calcineurine inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors), antiproliferative compounds (azathiopirin, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid sodium salt), and antibodies.\nIn this article we present new investigations towards immunosuppressive drugs, their structures and synthetic methods.",

High yield of this new method is caused by an increase in catalytic activity and life of used catalysts mainly due to an addition of steam to the reaction. The assistance of steam during the synthesis (the method is called \"Super Growth Chemical Vapor Deposition\"[3, 5]) leads to SWNTs forests having the height up to 4.0 mm. Such result is 100 times better in terms of efficiency than the previously reported records. Such synthesized, aligned materials are extremely high, super-highly dense and vertical-standing [Figs 2-4]. Moreover, this method leads to the purest SWNT material (over 99.98%) ever made. SWNTs are very easily separable from the catalysts and could be used without further purification. Highly efficient growth of SWNTs and DWNTs forests on conducting metal foils is also discussed. It is shown that such foils made of Ni-based alloys with Cr or Fe are excellent materials for the synthesis [3, 5, Fig. 3]. Under conditions where steam is added predominantly SWNTs (having the diameter 2.8 nm) are formed. Synthesis with an addition of oxygen-containing aromatics as growth enhancers is also described [figs. 16,17]. These enhancers caused the grow of CNTs having different diameters and wall numbers under identical reaction conditions. Creation of double-walled carbon nanotubes with populations as high as 84% and with the average size of 5.4 nm is possible with an insertion of methyl-benzoate. The creation of multi-walled CNTs is possible with an addition of benzaldehyde [9, Fig. 16].",

            "abstract": "Medicine is one of the most developing branches of knowledge. But even now there are still some diseases which are impossible to cure. Different cancers, antibiotic resistant bacterial infections and fungal pathogenesis infections are still everlasting problems. Thus, two ways of solutions are proposed. First is the return to natural medicines. From the ancient times plants have been used in medicine and the natural products have been an important source of drugs. Nowadays isolation and identification of these compounds, together with the determination of their biological activity, also play an important role.\nLactones are the cyclic esters with a&nbsp;wide range of carbon atoms in a&nbsp;lactone ring. They are a&nbsp;very interesting group of compounds which reveal a&nbsp;wide spectrum of biological activity. Terpenoid, especially sesquiterpene lactones and coumarin derivatives, are found in plants of the Asteraceae and Apiaceae families as well as in many others organisms. The naturally occurring lactones often possess anti-inflamatory [1, 2], phytotoxic [3, 4], antiprotozoal [5], and antiviral activities [6]. They are also well known for their anticancer [7, 8] and antimicrobial activities [9, 10].\nThe second way of obtaining new biologically active lactones is the chemical synthesis of new potent structural analogs of natural bioactive compounds. However, the complexity of natural products and their derivatives may lead to limited supplies, especially when they have the chiral centers which are one of the most important factors influencing their biological activity. It also causes difficulties to determine the mechanism of action. For those reasons, structural simplification plays an important role in the development of analog design.\nThis review is focused on novel literature data about synthetic and natural lactones which reveal anticancer, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Presented compounds show potent biological activity and high selectivity with holding promises for further applications.",

            "abstract": "Chemically modified nucleotides, which are not normally present in genetic material, are called DNA adducts. This type of DNA modifications (damage) is directly related to processes of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Elevated levels of DNA adducts present in genetic material reflect exposure of humans to carcinogenic factors and are markers of increased risk of cancer [1]. For this reason different methods useful for quantitative and qualitative analyses of DNA adducts are used in the field of cancer prevention and research (Tab. 1). Enzymatically-catalyzed methylation of cytosine, observed mostly in so called CpG islands, is a&nbsp;frequent endogenous modification of genetic material. Such a&nbsp;DNA methylation is a&nbsp;key factor involved in regulation of gene expression, and methylation status of oncogenes and tumor supressor genes is an important biomarker of carcinogenesis. As such, analytical methods for assessment of DNA methylation are of great importance for molecular diagnostics of cancer.\nDuring the last decade significant progress has been made in methods available for quantitative, qualitative and structural analyses of biological molecules. Among intensively developed tools for bioanalyses are methods of mass spectrometry. Spectrometers that are based on two methods of ionization, namely electrospray ionization (ESI) [30] and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) [48], are particularly suitable for analyses of biological macromolecules: proteins and nucleic acids. Currently available mass spectrometers, together with microscale methods for sample preparation and separation, significantly increased sensitivity and accessible mass range of analyses. New generation of \"user-friendly\" instruments is developed to bring the techniques directly into the workplaces of biological and clinical investigators.\nThis review demonstrates representative examples of mass spectrometry techniques used for qualitative analyses of nucleotide modifications and adducts present in genetic material of humans. In this field several methods base on spectrometers with electrospray ionization. Generated ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio in an analyzer by electric fields; among different ion analyzers frequently used in this methods are single or triple quadrupole and ion traps (Fig. 1). Among other methods available for assessment of DNA adducts is so called Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (Fig. 2) [41]. The most frequently applied method for the assessment of DNA methylation is based on methylation-specific PCR reaction. Products of such PCR reactions are analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry [54] (Fig. 3). In summary, new powerful methods of mass spectrometry that made available qualitative analyses of damage and modifications of human genetic material found their important place in modern biological and medical laboratories.",

            "abstract": "The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azides and terminal alkynes, known as the Huisgen reaction, constitutes a&nbsp;powerful tool for the synthesis of versatile molecules containing carbon - heteroatom bond. The use of a&nbsp;copper(I) salt in this reaction allowed Sharpless to develop the concept of \"click chemistry\" [1]. This strategy is based on reactions between small units characterized by mild reaction conditions, versatility, high yields and stereospecificity.\nThe chemistry of nucleic acids and nucleoside analogues is undergoing rapid developments and numerous compounds from these classes of compounds are used in medicinal treatment. Analogues of nucleoside constitute a&nbsp;class of drugs that possesses either anticancer or/and antiviral activity (against HIV, HSV, VZV or HCV viruses) [3]. Many modified oligonucleotides show biological activity. As potential drugs oligonucleotides are employed in antisense, antigen and aptamer strategies. An antisense therapeutic agent acts on the pathogenic mRNA causing inactivation of the target whereas an antigen agent acts on DNA and aptamer on unwanted protein.\nIt is not surprising that number of research groups are trying to join the concept of click chemistry with nucleic acids chemistry. In this way, it is possible to obtain new molecules like base- or sugar-modified nucleosides, nucleosides, bioconjugates and olignucleotides. The copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition CuAAC allows to functionalize DNA, for example by labelling it through attaching small molecules to DNA. Two general strategies have been developed for this purpose: presynthetic and postsynthetic labelling. In the presynthetic method nucleotide monomers are labelled before DNA synthesis and purification. In the postsynthetic strategy DNA containing small reactive groups is synthesized first and then it is conjugated with the desired molecules. CuAAC is also a&nbsp;convenient method for the synthesis of modified oligonucleotides in which phosphodiester linkage is replaced by 1,2,3-triazole or for a&nbsp;solid phase synthesis. Such molecules appear to be useful in medicine, molecular diagnostic (e.g. fluorescent dyes) or mechanistic molecular model in the future.",

            "abstract": "2,7-Naphthyridine is one of the six structural isomers of pyridopyridines. More than one hundred years ago, Gabriel and Colman discovered the isomer 2,7-naphthyridine, and named it \"copiryne\" [3]. From among of all naphthyridines, the synthesis and properties of the copyrine derivatives have not yet been thoroughly investigated. This paper reviews the synthetic and natural 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives which have been reported to possess various biological activity. a&nbsp;large number alkaloids containing the 2,7-naphthyridine scaffold have been isolated from plants and marine organisms [13-18]. The natural marine alkaloids can be classified into two groups. The bicyclic lophocladines were isolated from the red alga Lophocladia sp. [12]. The pyridoacridines represent a&nbsp;large and growing class the polycyclic alkaloids from sponges, ascidians or tunicates [15, 16]. Many of this natural compounds exhibited cytotoxic, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and sedative activity. The broad spectrum of biological activity of copyrine alkaloids is the main of reason for the preparation of new 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives also by the synthetic route. So far, about fifty different methods of synthesizing the 2,7-naphthyridine ring have been published. This study described synthesis only biologically active 2,7-naphthyridine analogues. Biological investigations have shown that copyrine derivatives have a&nbsp;wide spectrum of actions. Antitumor, antimicrobial, analgesic and anticonvulsion activities have been found. Most of 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives have been studied as antitumor agents. Many papers described synthesis and pharmacological properties the best active and highly selective PDE5 inhibitor (T-0156) [55]. So far, none of 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives has been applied as a&nbsp;drug.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen compounds, as an essential component of many reactions occurring in living organisms, become the object of an extensive research. These compounds became the focus of interest after the properties of nitric oxide, currently the best known nitrogen oxide, had thoroughly been studied [1-3]. Recently, particular attention has been paid to nitroxyl (HNO/NO-), which is the product of one-electron reduction of NO\u2022 [4]. Formation of nitroxyl in vivo is still controversial. It seems that this compound could be formed by the reaction of S-nitrosothiols with other thiol proteins (e.g. GSH), directly through the nitric oxide synthetase (NOS), through the oxidation of hydroxylamine by the peroxidase activity of heme proteins or as a&nbsp;result of reduction of nitric oxide NO\u2022 [5, 6]. Nitroxyl is a&nbsp;liable compound due to dimerization, so it is necessary to use its donors in experiments. Angeli's salt which forms HNO at physiological pH is the most commonly used donor [7]. Moreover, Piloty's acid, cyanamide, diazonium diolates or a&nbsp;group of acyloxy nitroso compounds are also used. There are some difficulties with detection of nitroxyl in biological systems. So far, nitroxyl was indirectly identified by detection of N2O, a&nbsp;product of HNO dimerization. Presently, nitroxyl is an object of intensive studies aiming at finding techniques of its direct detection. Recently two such techniques have been designed: one using the reaction of HNO with triarylphosphines, and the other with BOT1 (staining agent) complexed with copper ions, which gives fluorescent signals revealing HNO in living cells [8, 9]. Nitroxyl turned out to have great pharmacological potential [10, 11]. It was demonstrated that this compound affected the activity of many proteins reacting with their thiol groups [12, 13]. Moreover, HNO/NO- influences the contractility of blood vessels and therefore has inotropic and lusitropic effects on myocardium [14]. Nitroxyl seems to be very promising in treating cancerous diseases as it inhibits the activity of an enzyme involved in the process which is the most important for cancer cells - glycolysis [15].",

Hydrogen sulfide, like nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) is a&nbsp;signaling molecule in different systems [4]. Moreover, hydrogen sulfide has other various biological properties [8]. It induces hypotension in vivo and vasodilation in vitro by opening KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle cells [2, 5, 15]. Deficiency of H2S may contribute to atherogenesis in some patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, in whom the metabolism of homocysteine to cysteine and H2S is compromised by vitamin B6 deficiency. Reduced H2S production in brain was observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, excess of H2S may lead to mental homoretardation in patients with Down's syndrome and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypotension associated with septic shock [6]. This review summarizes the endogenous metabolism, physiological and pathological function of hydrogen sulfide.",

            "abstract": "In 1938, Szebell\u00e9dy and Somogyi [1-7] have proposed an important methodological innovation in analytical chemistry. This methodology was termed coulometric titration. This paper presents an overview of the principles of operation and, in broad outline, applications of this methodology. Moreover, a&nbsp;short biography and scientific achievements of professor Laszlo Szebell\u00e9dy are presented in the introduction.\nChapter 1 of this review outlines the theoretical background and general description of coulometric titration. In this new technique, the electrical current generates a&nbsp;titrant that chemically reacts with an analyte. The amount of the analyte is determined from the quantity of the electrical charge passed until the point of chemical equivalence has been reached, according to the 2nd Faraday's law of electrolysis. The new methodology offers several significant advantages over a&nbsp;conventional volumetric procedure, such as elimination of problems connected with the preparation, standardization and storage of standard solutions.\nIn Chapter 2, an evolution of the method after the Second World War is presented. In these times, stable constant current sources became easy to construct [13-15]. Consequently, coulometric titrations started to use a&nbsp;constant current system. Under these conditions, the total number of coulombs consumed can be calculated readily from the intensity of current and the duration of electrolysis. Coulometric titrations have been developed for all types of volumetric titrations: oxidation-reduction [19-28], precipitation [17, 18], complex formation [37] and neutralization reactions [39, 40]. The generation of various titrants and possibilities of application are described. Special attention is devoted to the electrochemical generation of reagents which are not ordinarily utilized in conventional volumetric analysis owing to the instability of their solutions such as bromine, chlorine, silver(II) and titanium(III). Moreover, the coulometric titration procedure is significantly more sensitive than the volumetric titration, and it is particularly suited to automation, because complex mechanical devices such as an automatic burette are not required. The new method appeared to be an attractive alternative to all forms of the volumetric titration. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the contribution of Polish academic chemistry teachers to the development of the method discussed [57-89, 91-100].\nAdvantages and disadvantages of the method are listed in the last Chapter (Summary). Each Chapter includes selected works related to the history of the subject.",

            "abstract": "The metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a&nbsp;novel group of molecular sieves discovered in the last decade of the twentieth century. Most of conventional molecular sieves such as microporous zeolites and zeolite-like materials, ordered mesoporous materials (M41S) are typical inorganic compounds. Although their synthesis often involves an assistance of organic compounds acting as structure directing agents and organic solvents are sometimes applied during their crystallization, the organics are always removed from resulted products (mainly by calcinations). The MOFs are crystalline materials build of metal ions or ion clusters coordinatively bonded with organic segments (linkers) that form porous (one-, two-, or three- dimensional) structures. The various coordination number of selected metal and the nature of organic linkers allow to prepare a&nbsp;great variety of structures with different properties. The inorganic components comprise a&nbsp;great variety of transition (e.g. Zn Cu, Fe, rare earths) and base metal (e.g. Al) cations of different valence. The organic linkers are functionalized compounds containing O, N, P, S atoms (i.e. carboxylates, phosphonates, sulfonates, cyanides, amines, imidazoles) enable to chelate the inorganic cations. The organic subunits can be additionally modified by substitution of other functional groups (halogens, hydroxyls, aminogroups).\nThe MOF materials are mostly prepared similarly as zeolitic materials by crystallization in solvothermal conditions. The solvents (water or organic compounds) can play a&nbsp;role of templates, although sometimes additional structure directing agents are admitted into the initial mixtures. The crystallization is always conducted in moderate temperatures (20-200\u00b0C). After removal of solvents well ordered pore systems are available for selective adsorption and for other applications. The thermal stability of this family of molecular sieves is obviously lower than that of inorganic materials, but most of them can withstand heating at 350-400\u00b0C, which still makes them suitable for variety of potential applications.\nThe adsorption properties of MOFs makes them very appealing for practical application. The recorded surface areas of some types are overwhelming and they surpass 5000 m2/g. The high adsorption capacity is very promising for storage of fuels (natural gas, hydrogen) or waste gases (CO2, SO2) as well as for their separation. The great and very fast growing variety of structures and chemical compositions brings also a&nbsp;hope to use them as efficient catalysts. The metal segments, functional groups in organic blocks as well as occluded or encapsulated species can play a&nbsp;role of catalytically active sites. The MOF materials can be also applied as matrices for sensors, pigments, and microelectronic or optical devices.",

            "abstract": "This article reviews results of studies, collected in the literature, related to complexation abilities of pyridine N-oxides, including forms and properties of d- and f-metal ion complexes with this group of ligands. In this paper the synthetic pathways of the ligands, based on an oxidation of the corresponding heterocyclic compounds are presented (Scheme 3) [2, 4, 5]. Substituted pyridine N-oxides form an interesting group of compounds, which have found numerous applications [296-299, 314-318]. They have been used in catalysis, crystal engineering, synthesis of coordination polymers, as well as drugs and components in pharmaceutical chemistry [300-309]. Some of them are useful in destroying of microorganisms and the HIV virus [277, 278, 303-307]. Moreover, they are important compounds in the thermal and photochemical oxidation processes [296-299].\nThe complexes of metal ions with the N-oxide ligands can be formed by binding an oxygen atom of the N\u2192O group, and/or by binding the substituents present in the aromatic ring, e.g. oxygen atoms of carboxylic groups. The complexes can be obtained in monomeric [64, 159], dimeric [58] or polymeric forms [60, 153, 175]. The formation of polymeric forms is more effective when the distance between the positions of COOH and N\u2192O groups in the aromatic ring increases [168]. Complexes of Ln3+ ions and particularly of Eu3+ with pyridine N-oxides are good luminescent materials, better than their heterocyclic counterparts [180, 211]. The emission intensity of europium ions in these systems depends on the efficiency of the LMCT (ligand-metal charge transfer) and LMET (ligand-metal energy transfer) transitions, as well as on electron-donor properties of the substituents present in the pyridine N-oxide ring [37, 132, 155]. a&nbsp;special role in the complexation of Ln3+ ions plays cryptands, which can encapsulate the metal ion. This process protects the metal ion from a&nbsp;penetration of its first coordination sphere by solvent molecules or counterions [245, 246]. The complexes of europium(III) with macromonocyclic, macrobicyclic and acyclic ligands, equipped with photoactive units such as pyridine N-oxide, 2,2'-bipyridine-N,N'-dioxide or 3,3'-biisoquinoline-2,2'-dioxide in solutions, solid states, and incorporated in a&nbsp;silicate matrices by sol-gel method, gained a&nbsp;lot of attention [247-274].",

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of optical activity was discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1848. Since this time, chirality of organic compounds observed in biological systems has became a&nbsp;central theme in scientific research. Synthesis and quantitation of enantiomerically pure compounds is important for a&nbsp;wide range of applications. Chirally pure compounds are required not only by pharmacology, but they are also of interest in cosmetic and food industry and many other applications.\nSimilarity of enantiomers in their chemical and physical properties, except for optical rotation, makes their separation and detection very difficult. Until now, many methods have been used for the enantioselective discrimination of organic compounds, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), capillary electrophoresis (CE) and chromatography (GC, HPLC), where an interference of a&nbsp;solvent cannot be excluded.\nRecent studies have shown that mass spectrometry (MS) is an alternative approach to traditional method for chiral recognition and determination of enantiomeric composition. Although, mass spectrometry has been considered as insensitive to chirality because enantiomers have the same mass and show identical mass spectra, it is now accepted as important tool for differentiating of enantiomeric compounds through their interactions with chiral reference molecules (Fig. 1). The ability to transfer diastereomeric non-covalent complexes between chiral selectors and analyte enantiomers, which differ in stability, into the gas-phase and measure such differences trough mass spectrometric ion abundances, has appeared with development of soft ionization techniques such electrospray ionization (ESI), fast atom bombardment (FAB) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Mass spectrometry-based methods for chiral recognition and quantitative determination of enantiomeric purity are attractive due to their speed, high sensitivity, low sample consumption, tolerance to impurities and ability to probe the analyte in a&nbsp;solvent free environment.\nCurrently, there are four well-defined approaches for determining a&nbsp;measure of enantiomer discrimination, using either single-stage or tandem mass spectrometry. They can be classified into the following categories: (1) measurement of the relative abundance of diastereomeric complexes between chiral reference compound and the enantiomers (usually one isotopically labeled [10]), (2) enantioselective ion/molecule reaction between diastereomeric complexes and chiral or achiral reactants [11], (3) kinetic method [12] and (4) collision-induced dissociation (CID) of diastereomeric adducts in a&nbsp;tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiment [61, 62].\nOver the past decade, new approaches to chiral separation and analysis of enantiomers have been introduced, where molecules are separated based on their mobility (ion mobility spectrometry) [66].",

            "abstract": "Alternative probes of the molecular electronic and bond structure recently derived in the Information-Theory (IT) are surveyed. The electron redistribution accompanying the bond formation, from the (molecularly placed) free atoms of the promolecule to the bonded Atoms-in-Molecules (AIM), generates the associated displacements in alternative measures of the information content of electronic probabilities. It is shown that these information densities represent sensitive probes into the entropic origins and the structure/multiplicity of chemical bonds. Local displacements in the molecular Shannon entropy and the missing information (entropy deficiency) relative to the promolecular reference provide efficient tools for detecting/localizing the chemical bonds and monitoring the promotion/hybridization changes the bonded atoms undergo in the molecular environment. The distribution of the negative non-additive Fisher information in the Atomic Orbital (AO) resolution similarly generates the \"Contra-Gradience\" (CG) probe for localizing the bonding regions in molecules. Illustrative applications of these novel IT tools in exploring the electronic structure and patterns of chemical bonds in typical molecules are reported.\nThe Orbital Communication Theory (OCT) of the chemical bond is introduced. It can be used to explore both the the overall/localized bond-orders and their covalent/ionic composition. In this description the molecule is treated as the information system which propagates the probabilities (\"signals\") of the underlying AO \"events\" of the electron allocations to basis functions. This molecular communication network generates the entropic measures of the chemical bond multiplicity and its covalent (communication noise) and ionic (information flow) components for both the molecule as a&nbsp;whole and its diatomic fragments. The conditional probabilities of this information scattering throughout the molecule or the subsystems of interest are generated from the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, applied in the bonding subspace of the molecule determined by the system occupied Molecular Orbitals (MO). They are proportional to the squares of the corresponding elements of the first-order density matrix, also known in the standard SCF LCAOMO MO theory as the Charge-and-Bond-Order (CBO) matrix, which are related to the quadratic (Wiberg) index of the chemical bond multiplicity. OCT uses the standard IT descriptors of the molecular information channel to characterize the scattering of electron probabilities throughout the communication network via to the system chemical bonds: the average conditional-entropy of the molecular \"output\" distribution given the molecular \"input\" signal measures the channel communication-noise due to electron delocalization and reflects the overall IT-covalency in the molecule, while the complementary descriptor of the network mutual-information (information-capacity) in the promolecular \"input\" and molecular \"output\" determines the system IT-ionicity. The diatomic bond multiplicities from OCT reproduce the Wiberg bond-order in diatomic molecules and generate efficient tools for indexing the connectivities between AIM, at the same time providing an adequate representation of the bond differentiation known from intuitive chemical considerations.\nIt is argued that the chemical bond concept embodies all dependencies between AO used to construct the bonding subspace of the molecule. The interaction between the specified pair of AO in the molecule thus exhibits both of the direct and indirect sources: the former results from the constructive interference between the two basis functions, while the latter have their roots in the implicit dependencies between the given basis functions through their dependence upon remaining AO in the molecular bonding subspace, due to their joint participation in the chemical bond system. Therefore, the indirect (through-bridge) contributions complement the familiar direct (through-space) bonds in the resultant pattern of the bond multiplicities in molecules. These implicit bond components, realized via AO intermediates, can be probed using both the \"quadratic\" bond orders of Wiberg and the associated IT descriptors of the cascade communications between AO. The explicit and implicit dependencies between basis functions in the bonding subspace can be both expressed in terms of the relevant elements of the molecular CBO matrix. The conditional probabilities of the direct and bridge (cascade) propagations of electronic probabilities between AO then determine in OCT the associated IT descriptors of these interactions. Representative results from the H\u00fcckel theory for illustrative \u03c0-electron systems (benzene, butadiene and linear polyenes) and from the standard Hartree-Fock (RHF) and Kohn-Sham (KS) calculations on butadiene, benzene and selected linear polymers are discussed. The resultant bond indices, combining the direct and indirect multiplicity contributions, are shown to generate a&nbsp;more balanced bonding perspective, compared to that resulting from the direct (Wiberg) bond-order approach. As illustrated for linear polymers, the direct bonding can be realized at relatively short distances, while the indirect mechanism effectively extends this range to more distant neighbors in the polymer chain.",

These compounds form structural motifs which range from simple bimetallic complexes to very specific aggregates that result from the versatile coordinating abilities of an alkoxo and aryloxo ligands (Fig. 1).\nFor the last few decades, there has been a&nbsp;growing interest in the development of the chemistry of metal alkoxides. Such interest derives from their fascinating structural chemistry, interesting catalytic properties, and a&nbsp;high potential for industrial utilization. The fact that most of them can generate highly pure and well-defined metal oxides (Table 4) has resulted in high research activity in chemistry of materials. Alkoxides and their derivatives, e.g. organometallics, are easily accessible and consist inexpensive compounds. Moreover, alkoxide ligands are easily removable during thermal treatment in a&nbsp;relatively low temperatures compare to conventional methods involving inorganic salts. Such compounds already have metal-oxygen bonds established on molecular structure. Due to these, alkoxides can generate oxide ceramics in a&nbsp;single step - so-called single-source precursors (SSPs) [11]. SSPs deliver appropriate metal elements of a&nbsp;final oxide product(s) eliminating the need to match the reaction rates required from a&nbsp;multicomponent mixture. All of these features made the metal oxides derived from metal alkoxides highly pure products possessing specific properties, chemical and mechanical resistance, excellent functions and shapes.\nThe aim of this article is to serve as a&nbsp;guide in understanding the principles in a&nbsp;one step strategy for oxide ceramics using metal alkoxide compounds. It includes synthesis of alkoxides and their derivatives, the concept of SSPs strategy and design of molecular precursors for oxide ceramic materials.",

            "abstract": "In the present review our interest is focused on the hydrogen bonded complexes of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) with strong proton donors, in particular with chloranilic (CLA) or squaric (H2SQ) acid. The x-ray diffraction studies show that, depending on the proton donor, various assemblies with the acid are formed, e.g. the infinite O-H...N hydrogen bonded chains without proton transfer in the case of the complex with CLA. On the other hand with H2SQ the assemblies of [HSQ]22--2TMP\u00b7H+ composition are created, in which the ionized HSQ-1 molecules are present in the form of dimers. These dimers are bound with the TMP\u00b7H+ cations on its both sides via the +N-H...O- hydrogen bonds. Picric acid forms with TMP the complex of the 2:1 composition with a&nbsp;double protonated TMP molecule. In the case of HI3 acid the interesting units of the (TMP\u00b7H+)2\u00b7TMP composition are formed, in which two TMP\u00b7H+ cations are coordinated with one TMP molecule through the +N-H...N bridges.\nIn the infrared spectra of the TMP complexes, both with CLA and H2SQ, the similar absorption continua are observed. They can be interpreted in terms of an asymmetric potential for the proton motion, with either the double minimum or the single broad minimum potential for the CLA and H2SQ complexes, respectively.\nAn analysis of the neutron scattering spectra concerns the phenomena of the tunneling splitting, quasielastic neutron scattering (QNS) and inelastic (INS) scattering. In the case of tunneling splitting neat TMP does not show any tunneling transitions in the \u00b5eV energy region, because they are overlapped by the elastic scattering band. In the case of the TMP\u00b7CLA complex four tunneling transitions are seen corresponding to the four crystallographically nonequivalent CH3 groups in the TMP molecule. In the spectrum of the complex with squaric acid the observed two transitions are ascribed to the two different CH3 groups. The two remaining CH3 group tunneling transitions are overlapped by the elastic scattering. The measurements in various low temperature ranges yield information about the shape of the CH3 group rotational potential. The shape of the potential is also reflected in the spectra of quasielastic scattering. In particular the temperature dependence of the quasielastic band allows us to find the activation energy for the CH3 rotations. Finally the inelastic neutron scattering spectra are analyzed in the energy range of the CH3 torsional modes (below 200 cm-1 = 25 meV). The analysis shows that for the complexes the torsional vibration frequencies are markedly lower than those for neat TMP. In the case of the TMP\u00b7CLA complex frequencies found are particularly low. They are close to the frequencies calculated for the TMP+ cation. a&nbsp;general conclusion can be drawn that in the complexes the CH3 groups behave more loosely than in neat TMP.",

            "abstract": "In this study we describe the most popular biomedical engineering nanoparticles including carbon nanotubes [17-20], liposomes [4-7], polymeric micells [11-13], quantum dots [3, 21-23], hydrogels [24-27], dendrimers [14-16] which are recently considered as modern drug carriers. These nanomaterials are applied for cancer diagnostic and targeted delivery of active compounds as chemotherapeutics in so called targeted therapy. Thus, we characterized the ideas of targeted therapy for which compositions of carriers with antibody are constructed (Figs. 3, 4). We also compared the traditional and targeted mechanisms [1, 3, 28-29] of drug delivery (Fig. 2). During targeted therapy only the essential dose of drug (less than during conventional chemotherapy) is delivering to the cancer cell. In additional, the application of targeted therapy reduces side effects, being very characteristic for the traditional treatment. The anticancer compound can selectively hits the target only, due to the presence of the ligands attached to the surface of nanocarirer. We characterized ligands which are often use in nanomedicine: antibodies [33-37], folic acid [30-33], peptides [33, 38, 39], aptamers [33, 40, 41] and transferrin [33, 42-44]. The purpose of this study is description of the bioconjugation of ligand-nanocarrier. This step is necessary and very important in synthesis of the novel drug delivery systems in targeted anticancer therapy. We report recent advances in the field showing the formation of amides (Figs. 6-8) [51-57], thioethers (Figs. 9-11) [52, 60-66], disulfides (Fig. 12) [69], and acethyl-hydrazone groups (Fig. 13) [73]. Special attention is paid to the process such as Diels-Alder (Figs. 14, 15) [74, 75] and \"click chemistry\" through the cycloaddition of Huisgen (Figs. 16, 17) [79-82]. We describe also the reaction of Staudinger [83] and the process of formation Schiff's base [84]. The processes enable very mild and selective modification of the carriers through formation of amide bound. These methods ware less popular but allow the fictionalization of nanocarriers in biomedical application. Each reaction or process needs special and individual environment and conditions, which are summarized in Table 1.",

            "abstract": "The ground state electronic energy represents a&nbsp;complicated function of the nuclear coordinates. Even for relatively small molecules this function may have many minima in the corresponding \"energy landscape\", very often myriads of minima, each of them corresponding to a&nbsp;stable configuration of the nuclei. This is why predicting the lowest-energy conformation or configuration represents a&nbsp;formidable task. There were many attempts to solve this problem for protein molecules, for which it is believed their native conformation corresponds to the lowest free energy. The challenge to find this conformation from a&nbsp;given sequence of amino acids is known as a&nbsp;\"second genetic code\". In fact all of these attempts based on some smoothing of the energy landscape. In the article some of these smoothing techniques are described, from a&nbsp;generic one to those, which finally turned out to be highly successful in finding native structures of globular proteins. When discussing the contributions to the conformational energy the importance of the hydrophobic effect as well as of the electrostatic interactions has been stressed. In particular it turned out that the dipole moments of the NH and of the CO bonds in proteins functioning in nature are oriented to good accuracy along the local intramolecular electric field. Thanks to enormous effort of the protein folding community it is possible to design such amino acid sequences, which fold to the desired protein 3D structure. a&nbsp;certain reliable theoretical technique of protein folding has been used to study a&nbsp;possibility of conformational autocatalysis. It turned out that a&nbsp;small protein of 32 amino acids, with carefully predesigned amino acid sequence, exhibits indeed such an effect, which may be seen as a&nbsp;model of the prion disease propagation.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen bonding belongs to the most important chemical interactions in life and geochemical processes as well as in technologies, that is documented in many review articles [1-10], monographs [11-17] and numerous publications. Figure 1 presents how \"popular\" are studies concerning hydrogen bonds (the term H-bond/bonding/bonded in a&nbsp;title, key-words or in abstract) in the last decade. First information about H-bond formation appeared at the end of XIX and a&nbsp;few other at beginning of XX centuries [19-24]. Most common definition of H-bonding stems from Pauling [27], whereas the newest IUPAC definition was published very recently [26].\nMost frequently H-bonding is experimentally described by geometry parameters [28, 32] - results of X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, but NMR and IR/Raman spectroscopies are also in frequent use. Characteristic of interactions by H-bonding is usually discussed in terms of energies [29-31], with use of various quantum chemical theories [54-57] and applications of various models as AIM [35, 41, 42, 45-48] and NBO [43, 44] which allowed to formulate detailed criteria for H-bond characteristics [35, 48]. H-bonds are classified as strong, mostly covalent in nature [7, 29, 34], partly covalent of medium strength [35] and weak ones, usually non-covalent [7, 29, 34, 35].\nTheoretical studies of H-bonding mainly concern equilibrium systems, however simulation of H-bonded complexes with controlled and gradually changing strength of interactions [61-71] are also performed. The latter is main source of data referring to effect of H-bonding on structural properties: changes in the region of interactions, short and long-distance consequences of H-bonding.\nApplication of the model [61] based on approaching hydrofluoric acid to the basic center of a&nbsp;molecule and fluoride to the acidic one, (Schemes 2 and 3) allows to study changes in molecular structure of para-substituted derivatives of phenol and phenolate [62, 64] in function of dB...H, or other geometric parameter of H-bond strength (Fig. 2). It is also shown that CO bond lengths in these complexes is monotonically related to H-bond formation energy and deformation energy due to H-bond formation [65]. Alike studies carried out for para-substituted derivatives of aniline and its protonated and deprotonated forms [77, 78, 81] give similar picture (Fig. 3). AIM studies of anilines [77, 78] lead to an excellent dependence of logarithm of electron density in the bond critical point and geometric parameter of H-bond strength, dB...H presented in Figure 4. Substituents and H-bond formation affect dramatically geometry of amine group [66] in H-bonded complexes of aniline as shown by changes of pyramidalization of bonds in amine group (Fig. 5).\nSome short- and long-distance structural consequences of H-bonding are shown by means of changes in ipso angle (for amine group) in the ring and ipso-ortho CC bond lengths (Fig. 6). Moreover, the mutual interrelations are in line with the Bent-Walsh rule [84, 86]. Changes of the strength of H-bonds in complexes of p-substituted aniline and its protonated and deprotonated derivative are dramatically reflected by aromaticity of the ring66 estimated by use of HOMA index [87, 88] (Fig. 7), where strength of H-bonding is approximated by CN bond lengths. Scheme 4 presents application of the SESE [91] (Substituent Effect Stabilization Energy) for description in an energetic scale joint substituent and H-bond formation effects.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen bond is analyzed very often since its importance in numerous chemical, physical and biological processes is very well known. It covers the broad range of various interactions; sometimes this is the subject of discussions and polemics if some of them may be classified as hydrogen bonds. This is because there are numerous definitions of hydrogen bond interaction, often they are hardly accepted since they are not univocal. For example one can mention different types of the proton acceptors for hydrogen bonds; one center electronegative atoms, multi-center acceptors such as \u03c0-electrons or even \u03c3-electrons. There are the other interactions which play the key role in various processes and phenomena. All are often named as no-covalent interactions but the other term, Lewis acid-Lewis base interactions seems to be more accurate. One can mention halogen bond, hydride bond or dihydrogen bond. These interactions may be treated as counterparts or competitors of hydrogen bond. The common characteristic for them, including hydrogen bond, is the electron charge transfer from the Lewis base to the Lewis acid. It was found that the amount of this transfer corresponds roughly to the strength of the interaction.\nIn recent years the \u03c3-hole concept was introduced and developed and it was applied to the Lewis base-Lewis acid interactions. According to this concept the atomic centers are characterized by the presence of the regions of positive and negative electrostatic potentials; very often both regions are detected even for atoms which are commonly known as electronegative ones. In such a&nbsp;way halogen atoms, especially if connected by covalent bond with carbon, may act as Lewis acids and also as Lewis bases. In the first case the halogen bond is formed, recently extensively studied.\nIn this review the characteristics of different Lewis base-Lewis acid interactions are given as well as their common features are presented.",

            "abstract": "The hydroformylation reaction was discovered by Otto Roelen in 1938. He studied the side processes occurring during the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with a&nbsp;cobalt catalyst and found some amounts of aldehydes formed from the olefin and syngas (H2CO) [1].\nThe hydroformylation found application in the chemical industry, mainly for production of n-butanal from propene. Aldehydes obtained by propene hydroformylation are subsequently hydrogenated to alcohols, used as solvents. Butanal can also be condensed to C8 aldehydes and alcohols, 2-ethylhex-2-enal and 2-ethylhexanol, important components for plasticizers such as dioctylphtalate. The hydroformylation reaction can be applied not only for the synthesis of aldehydes but also for other products. In particular, successful synthesis of quaternary carbon centers by hydroformylation has been reported in which the rhodium catalyst was modified with a&nbsp;ligand that serves as a&nbsp;catalytic directing group by covalently and reversibly binding to both the substrate and the catalyst.\nIonic liquids have been recognized as a&nbsp;novel class of solvents which can be successfully used for homogeneous catalysis [4]. Application of ionic liquids, non-aqueous and non-volatile solvents, has made it possible to construct biphasic systems in order to efficiently separate catalysts from organic products. It is also important that the properties of ionic liquids, such as solubility, acidity, or coordination ability, can be tuned by the use of different cations and anions.\nIn the ideal case, the ionic liquid is able to dissolve the catalyst and displays partial miscibility with the substrate. If the products have negligible miscibility in the ionic liquid, they can be removed by simple decantation, without extracting the catalyst. If the products are partially or totally miscible in the ionic liquid, separation of the products is more complicated [4e, 4h].\nThe main problem with catalytic systems for hydroformylation containing ionic liquid phase was a&nbsp;significant leaching of the catalyst out of the ionic liquid phase, which can be overcome by modifying neutral phosphane with ionic groups. Examples of such systems are presented in the article.\nIt was revealed that N-heterocyclic carbenes were formed in the biphasic hydroformylation reactions promoted by Rh complexes in an imidazolium ionic liquid [10]. Consequently, reactivity of the in situ formed Rh-carbene complexes can strongly influence on the hydroformylation reaction course [11].\nThe best methodology to perform the hydroformylation reaction would be a&nbsp;flow system in which the catalyst remains in the reactor and the substrates and products flow continuously into and out of the reactor. For the construction of such a&nbsp;system with soluble rhodium catalysts, ionic liquids could be considered as media used for the immobilization of the catalyst. The first example of continuous flow hydroformylation was reported by Cole-Hamilton [19, 20]. Different Supported Ionic Liquid Phase (SILP) catalysts have been examined in hydroformylation [15-17]. Interestingly, the neutral ligand can be applied efficiently in a&nbsp;continuous gas-phase SILP process, while in a&nbsp;typical biphasic system containing ionic liquid and organic solvent it would leach into the product phase.",

The paper will present the way of the proceedings from molecular receptor to new material with this receptor, so in other words from individual molecules to the new material with specific and previously planned properties. This process is presented for two types of molecules: aryloboronic acids and terpyridine.\nThe ability for rapid and reversible formation of boronic acids, esters of 1,2- and 1,3-diols resulted in that these compounds were used for the synthesis of sugar receptors and consequently to build the new generation of the sensors of sugars.\n2,2':6,2'-Terpyridine is ligand, that in solution forms complexes with most transition metal ions. This compound is used for the synthesis of functional polymers, dendrymers and fluorescent sensors of ions.\nThe presentation of the applicability of molecular receptors in the preparation of new functional materials promotes the new approach to the work of chemists. The basic research in which we define the properties of individual molecules and molecular receptors can be the beginning of the application of these compounds in the material chemistry. Additionally it can lead to the synthesis of the new materials with the specific properties or the selective construction of the measuring systems.\nThe process from the molecule that is characterized by well-studied properties to modern material chemistry is limited only by the imagination of chemists and by the demand for new organic materials in the industry and by the new generation of the selective measurement systems.",

            "abstract": "<p>The most demanded biomaterials for bone tissue engineering could be classified in two main sol-gel derived groups: bioglasses and organic-inorganic composites. The first of these include bioactive ceramics such as calcium phosphates (Tab. 2) [1], glasses and glass ceramics [2], and so-called inert ceramics (Tab. 1) such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, zirconium and titanium dioxide, and carbon-based materials [3, 4]. Second-group of compounds constitute bioactive organic-inorganic hybrids, generally based on organic matrix and various inorganic dopants. Biomaterials in contact with human plasma and bone stem cells form, on their surface, hydroxyapatite Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2 </sub>(HAp) and its derivatives (Tab. 2). HAp-layer initiates bone growth and reconstruction of treated fragment (Fig. 2). These materials, due to the high degree of biocompability are considered as the most valuable compounds for bone surgery [5]. Extremely rapid development of biomaterials used in medicine caused the production of implants with different properties (Scheme 1). The real revolution and technological progress have brought biomimetic composites that mimic naturally occurring solutions in living organisms. The role of such implants is not only replacing the damaged parts of body, but - due to the appropriate morphology and composition - stimulating the growth of living cells (Fig. 3) and final bone regeneration. This article is devoted to this type of biomaterials proposed for bone tissue engineering.</p>",

In recent decades, however, the new generations of inorganic-organic molecular sieves have been discovered such as MOF (Metal Organic Framework) and PMO (Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas). The youngest group of the molecular sieves is a&nbsp;fully organic system of ordered porous resins. Although the organic molecular sieves show lower thermal stability than conventional inorganic materials they seem very interesting and promising due to possible variety of mesoporous structures and great ability of modification by altering their composition and substitution of various functional groups.</p><p>The novel materials can be synthesized from different precursors although resols obtained by condensation of phenol and formaldehyde are most frequently applied. The porous structure can be obtained by adding the porogeneous agent into the polymerization mixture. The surfactants as well as triblock copolymers (Pluronics) are often used as such agents. They are thermally removed from the final product after completing the polymerization and thermal crosslinking. There are also successful attempts to apply a&nbsp;nanocasting for organized assembling the resin upon its formation. The functional groups can be formed either by adding the functionalized substrate into polymerization mixture or by introduction of chosen groups into resulted polymeric product. Extended thermal treatment of resulted porous resins at high temperatures often results in their carbonization which leads to formation of ordered porous carbons. Many authors drive their attention to produce the active carbons via the stage of porous resins.</p><p>The new family of the molecular sieves can be applied as selective adsorbents or membranes, but it is also likely that they could appear efficient catalysts (similarly as well known ion-exchange disordered resins).</p>",

These compounds play an important role in pharmaceutical industry, because they are substrates in the synthesis of various important therapeutics [1-3]. Methods presented in this work are divided into five main groups:</p><ol><li>enantioselective hydroxylation,</li><li>microbiological deracemization,</li><li>enzymatic kinetic resolution,</li><li>enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution,</li><li>enantioselective reduction.</li></ol><p>First two methods use only microorganisms like bacteria [4, 5, 10], fungi [6-8] or yeasts [11] as biocatalysts. Owing to the metabolic processes in the cells it was possible to obtain nonracemic arylallylic alcohol (results for method 2 are presented in Table 1). Unfortunately, the data were insufficient to create direct correlation between values of enantiomeric excess and types of applied microorganisms.</p><p>Methods 3 and 4 used only isolated enzymes as biocatalysts. They belong to two classes: hydrolases and oxidoreductases. Oxidoreductases were used in the enzymatic kinetic resolution based on the enantioselective oxidation [28] of one enantiomer of the racemic arylallylic alcohol. Nevertheless, hydrolases [12-27], mainly lipases, isolated from microorganisms are enzymes of common use in enzymatic kinetic resolution. Owing to this method it was possible to obtain final products with excellent enantioselectivity (results are presented in Tables 2 and 3). Because kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic resolution are related processes, in most cases similar enzymes are used. The choice of lipases as biocatalysts for method 4 was caused by the fact that they are able to catalyze enantioselective transesterification of arylallylic alcohols or their acetates. Furthermore, racemization is very important factor for efficacy of dynamic kinetic resolution processes. In most cases they are catalyzed by different types of complexes based on palladium [30, 31] and ruthenium [32, 34]. Final products prepared by this method had very high enantiomeric excesses and yields up to 93% (results are presented in Tables 4 and 5).</p><p>The only method, presented in this work, that allowed to use both enzymes [39-41] and microorganisms [35-38] as biocatalysts, was enantioselective reduction. This method allows to obtain nonracemic arylallylic alcohols with excellent enantiomeric excess and yields up to 85% (results are presented in Table 6).</p><p>In summary, all methods presented in this work show the advantages of biocatalysis as an alternative route to traditional chemical methods.</p>",

Binding of ions to surfactant bilayers, nucleic acids, proteins, and biological membranes markedly affects their stability and properties [2-8]. There are different techniques to measure the ion binding to interfaces, including: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [2, 18-20], the method based on measuring of electrophoretic mobility and the so-called zeta potential measurements [4, 21], the method based on measuring of a&nbsp;ratio of acid-to-base forms of the spectrophotometric indicator pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline, PADA [12], and the chemical-trapping method [22]. The above-mentioned methods permit investigation of the binding of either cations or anions to interfaces.</p><p>Many theories and models had been proposed to describe quantitatively the interactions and distribution of ions at a&nbsp;charged surface. The earliest one was proposed by Gouy and Chapman [23, 24]. However, the classical Gouy-Chapman theory was too simplified due to the neglect of the geometrical dimensions of the ions [27]. Other theories have been developed on the basis of the Poisson-Boltzmann theory and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (equation 3). This equation has been modified by an introduction of different terms [25, 42]. Recently, Radke et al. proposed interesting models of the ion distribution near the interface: the ion binding model [28] (Fig. 1) and the ion image charge interaction model [51] (Fig. 3).</p><p>Interaction and binding of ions with interfaces is related to the so-called specific ion effects arising at exchanging ions of the same valence. Franz Hofmeister, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Prague was the first who studied these effects systematically [13, 14]. The specific ion effects play a&nbsp;significant role in a&nbsp;wide range of biological and physicochemical phenomena from the salt solubility, electrolyte activities, the surface tension of electrolyte solutions, values of pH and zeta potentials, the buffer acting, microemulsion microstructure, cloud points of polymers and surfactant solutions to the action of ions on ion-channels in biological membranes (ion transport across membranes), in enzyme activities, in bacterial growth, and in the interaction between membranes [15, 16]. The biological cell activity is also connected to Hofmeister effects. The ion specificity observed is, in fact, a&nbsp;combination of different subtle effects, such as ion size, hydration of ions, ion effect on interfacial water structure, electrostatic and dispersion interactions, thermal motion, and fluctuations [26, 29-31]. Because of a&nbsp;combination of those different effects, Hofmeister effects remain unexplained by the present theories of physical chemistry [16].</p>",

Examples include simplicity of their syntheses on an industrial scale, low synthesis costs, high thermal stability and durability, an excellent repeatability and very low degree of degradation during cyclic hydrogen loading and recovery. On the other hand, the potential use of MOFs as hydrogen reservoirs is to some extent limited due to the fact that the low temperatures of 77 K are required for effective adsorption of hydrogen in the microporous structures of MOFs. Nowadays, the research on MOFs is carried in two directions. In particular, there are intensive studies on increasing of the concentration of hydrogen adsorbed at low temperatures in order to determine the limiting value for which maintaining the reservoir at the temperature of liquid hydrogen would be economically viable. It seems that the limiting concentration is being currently reached. The second direction of research is to increase the limiting value of temperature at which the concentration of adsorbed hydrogen is acceptable.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Refractory metal nanopowders have recently been of interest as starting materials for preparation of heavy alloys with exceptionally good mechanical properties resulting from their structure homogeneity at a&nbsp;nanoscopic level. In the light of recently published papers, the combustion synthesis seems to be a&nbsp;promising technique for the large-scale production of metal nanopowders. In this method, the self-sustaining internal combustion of energetic composites is used to produce useful materials. The energy released in the combustion wave, propagating through a&nbsp;pressed sample of the green mixture, causes a&nbsp;rapid increase in temperature which in turns enables the processes and reactions with high activation barriers to proceed. Unbalanced conditions and high time and space variability of temperature in combustion wave are conducive to the creation of compounds and structures that are difficult to produce using other methods. Thanks to this combustion synthesis there is a&nbsp;source of simple and complex metal oxides, ceramic materials, metals and intermetallic compounds as well as various composites of the substances, both in powdery and compact forms. The product form and its microstructure depends on the synthesis conditions, especially on the size and morphology of substrate particles, reactants ratio, the initial density, the presence and concentration of additives, temperature and external pressure [1-6]. Metal powders are typically produced by reduction of relevant oxides. Aluminum, magnesium, zinc, calcium, zirconium, titanium, silicon, carbon and their mixtures or compounds are used as reducers [11]. If the combustion temperature is excessively high (above 2000\u00b0C) coarse metal powders are usually produced. The initially formed crystallites are irregular in shape, they melt on the surface and agglomerate giving even bigger particles. To overcome this problem, alkali metal halide is included as an additional reactant in the system. The additive melts in the combustion wave, reduces the combustion temperature, aids in transportation of the main reactant species, which positively affects the size and shape of combustion product particles. In addition, molten salt prevents grain growth by forming a&nbsp;protective layer around the particles. The current paper reviews recently published works (mainly by H.H. Nersisyan et al. [7, 12-23]) on molten salt assisted combustion synthesis (SACR) of tungsten, tantalum and molybdenum nanopowders. a&nbsp;detailed description of the synthesis method including its specific features, the experimental procedure, combustion parameters and macro-kinetic aspects of chemical reactions in the combustion wave, and characterization of the metal nanopowders are presented.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Asymmetric hydrogen transfer (ATH) is one of the methods of stereoselective reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds (Scheme 6). Complexes of the platinum group metals (Noyori catalysts) are the most common catalysts for ATH reactions. The specific structure of the Noyori catalyst allows to activate two hydrogen atoms. These atoms are transferred from donor to acceptor in the form of hydride ion and proton (Scheme 1). Depending on the used catalyst the transfer hydrogenation of ketons can proceed by direct and indirect transfer mechanism. The direct hydride transfer from a&nbsp;donor to an acceptor proceeds via a&nbsp;six-membered transition state (3) (Scheme 2). The indirect hydride transfer proceeds through the formation of an intermediate metal hydride. a&nbsp;monohydride (HL<sub>n</sub>MH) and or a&nbsp;dihydride (L<sub>n</sub>MH<sub>2</sub>) can be formed depending on the catalyst that is used (Scheme 3). In the monohydride route, the reduction proceeds in the inner sphere of the metal (four-membered transition state (4)) or in the outer sphere of the metal (six-membered transition state (5)) (Scheme 4). The proposed reduction of carbonyl compounds in the ATH reaction by Noyori catalysts uses the mechanism of the hydride ion and proton transfer from the donor to the catalyst and the formation of the monohydride. In the indirect transfer hydrogenation the hydride ion and proton are transferred from the monohydride to the acceptor (Scheme 5, 7).</p><p>ATH reactions that lead to chiral alcohols are conducted in organic solvents or in water. Hydrogen donors most often used in organic solvent reactions are propan-2-ol or an azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine (Tab. 1, 6). Sodium formate is usually used as hydrogen donor in the reactions conducted in water. Yield and enantioselectivity of the reaction depend on many factors the most important of which are: the structure of a&nbsp;substrate, hydrogen donor and solvent that were used, the reaction time, substrate concentration, and the S/C ratio [2]. In the case of asymmetric reduction conducted in water the solvent pH is also of great importance [3, 7, 8]. An optimal pH range depends on the type of a&nbsp;catalyst [7, 8]. ATH reactions conducted in water are distinguished by a&nbsp;shorter reaction time and higher enantioselectivity than the reactions conducted in organic solvents. In addition, catalysts used in the ATH reactions are more stable in water allowing reuse of the catalyst without loss of its activity. This paper presented examples of the use of specific catalysts in asymmetric reactions of hydrogen transfer. In particular, i&nbsp;drew attention to the reactions running in the aquatic environment due to the above-mentioned advantages of this solvent. The authors focused specifically on bifunctional catalysts based on Ru(II) and Rh(III) on the account of wide usage of the catalysts of that type in ATH reactions in water and their good performance [8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22]. p-Cymene is the most common aromatic ligand in catalysts based on Ru(II) while in the case of catalysts with Rh(III) the most common is anionic pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. In both cases the second most common ligands are diamines or amino alcohols (Scheme 8). There are better performance and enantioselectivity when diamines are used as ligands. Attempts to replace diamines and amino alcohols by Schiff bases (Scheme 13) in the catalysts containing Rh(III) proved poor results due to a&nbsp;very low enantioselectivity of conducted reactions (Tab. 7).</p>",

The stereochemical description of their molecules in the solid and gas phase as well as intra- and intermolecular-interactions in crystals have been determined [4-6]. The structural studies of analyzed molecules indicated the planarity of the benzo[b]furan and coumarin ring systems. The oxygen or carbon atoms of the substituents, -OH, -OCH<sub>3</sub>, -C(=O)CH<sub>3</sub> and -COOH, are nearly coplanar with the aromatic ring. The hydroxyl and acetyl groups, being in the ortho position, are coplanar with the aromatic ring and the formation of the intramolecular O-H...O hydrogen bond in all three states of matter is observed. Its strength is around 18 kcal/mol. Several conformers of studied compounds, differing in the orientation of the methoxy, acetyl and/or carboxyl groups, were analyzed. Next, the electrochemical method was used to synthesize novel copper and zinc complexes with the oxygen donor benzo[b]furan and coumarin derivatives. The Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been obtained with carboxylic acids as ligands whereas hydroxy ligands reacted only with copper [6]. The geometry of metal-ligand interaction of new compounds has been determined using a&nbsp;single crystal X-ray crystallography and an X-ray absorption spectroscopy [7, 8]. The combination of these two methods revealed that for some compounds cation environment could depend on the form of the solid sample. In the microcrystalline zinc complexes (studied by EXAFS) the cation is penta-coordinated (ZnO<sub>5</sub>) with the Zn-O distances being ca 1.98(3) A\u00c5. In the recrystallized complex (analyzed by the X-ray diffraction) it was found that zinc is tetra-coordinated (ZnO<sub>4</sub>). The Cu(II) cation in the single-crystal form of the complex with the carboxylic acid 5 is penta-coordinated to the carboxylate groups and the ethanol molecule. The bridging COO- groups stabilize the dinuclear complex center Cu2O10. The powdered form of this complex is based on the Cu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> units, indicating the absence of the ethanol molecule in the coordination sphere. In the series of the Cu(II) complexes with the hydroxy derivatives of benzo[b]furan and coumarin a&nbsp;centrosymmetric coordination polyhedron of metal exhibits a&nbsp;square-planar geometry (CuO<sub>4</sub>).

This generates the chirality axis. Therefore 1,1'-binaphthyl derivatives exist as two enantiomeric forms called atropoisomers. Moreover, 1,1'-binaphthyls with substituents at 2,2' position exhibit higher rotational barriers around the 1,1'-axis, which affect a&nbsp;very stable chiral configuration. The classical examples of such molecules is 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (BINOL), which has become one of the most utilized chiral ligand and auxiliary for diverse asymmetric syntheses. The unchallenged success of BINOL and its derivatives in the field of transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric reactions or C-C bond forming reactions promoted worldwide an advancement of organic synthesis. The first synthesis of BINOL as racemate was described in 1873. Since then there have been found numerous efficient methods of racemic or enantiomerically pure BINOL preparation and its derivatization. In order to present a&nbsp;brief overview of the most convenient and facile routes to obtain racemic and nonracemic symmetrically substituted 1,1'-binaphthyls based on stoichiometric and catalytic oxidative coupling, classical optical resolution, kinetic enzymatic resolution of racemic mixture or regioselective modification of the binaphthol scaffold the following article is presented.</p>",

This violation was explained by the postulate concerning the existence of a&nbsp;3-center 4-electron bond between a&nbsp;hypervalent heteroatom and two axial electronegative ligands. The bond is the a&nbsp;combination of two ligand orbitals and a&nbsp;pz orbital of a&nbsp;central heteroatom which results in the formation of three molecular orbitals. The distances between the central atom and these two ligands are longer than the length of the typical sp2 bonds, such as equatorial ones. Moreover, the effective electron density is shifted from the central atom towards the axial ligands what results in the fulfillment of the octet rule of this atom. The geometry of this system is trigonal bipyramid (Fig. 2), except from compounds having three 3-center 4-electron (3c-4e) bonds which have tetragonal bipyramid geometry (Fig. 3). The term \"geometry\" includes positions of ligands and lone electron pairs. The stability of hypervalent compounds is affected by a&nbsp;few factors: electronegativity of ligands, formation of five-membered cyclic structures involving the central atom and the number of electron shells of the central atom. Martin proposed three-symbol notation N-X-L for these structures, which was further modified (Tab. 1). Hypervalent compounds can isomerize according to various mechanisms: Berry pseudorotation (Scheme 1), turnstile rotation (Scheme 2), cuneal inversion (Scheme 3), lever mechanism (Scheme 4), or Bailar twist (Scheme 5). Furthermore, hypervalent structures of 10-X-4 and 10-X-5 type with trigonal bipyramid geometry, C<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>2</sub> symmetry and at least three different ligands can exist as optically active species (Tab. 2, Fig. 5-7, Scheme 6), especially the \"spiro\" ones, which are resistant to isomerization. In 1977 Martin and Balthazor proposed extended Cahn-Ingold-Prelog convention for description of the absolute configuration of chiral hypervalent compounds (Fig. 5).</p>",

This paper reviews the use of menthol and new classes of cooling agents, that have been discovered since the 1970s, in cosmetic preparations. We have presented here 57 chemical structures. In addition, we briefly touch upon cold receptors and mechanism of action. Finally, we add up, recent findings on the production of cooling ingredients in the world. The underlying process in thermoreception depends on ion transport across cellular membranes. Thermoreceptors belong to a&nbsp;class of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Among them are temperature-sensitive thermoreceptors TRPM8 or TRPA1. Certain types of chemical agonists activate the same thermoTRP channels, as for example menthol or icilin. Only the (-)-menthol enantiomer possesses clean, desirable minty odor and intense cooling properties (Fig. 1). Natural menthol is normally about 99.0% to 99.6% pure, with the remaining impurities being other constituents found in the cornmit oil. Synthetic (-)-menthol is normally about 99.8% pure and has less of the minty top note than the natural menthol. The other natural and synthetic compounds being menthol-related coolants are showed in Figure 3, as for example, menthone 1,2-glycerol ketal (17). From among 3-carboxamide-p-menthane derivatives as commercial cooling agents (Fig. 4), there are for example N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide (25) as WS-3 and [ethyl 3-(p-menthane-3-carboxamido)acetate] as WS-5, which is currently the coldest of all commercial cooling agents (27). Other examples of recently discovered carboxamide coolants belong to a&nbsp;series of analogs of WS-23 (28). Of particular interest are various aryl p-menthane-3-carboxamides, such as N-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-3-p-menthanecarboxamide (36), which was reported to have 100 times more cooling intensity than menthol (Fig. 6). In 2010, Furrer disclosed a&nbsp;series of new p-menthane carboxamide and WS-23 analogs as cooling agents [56]. Three particularly potential cooling agents 50, 51 and 52 are shown in Figure 9.</p>",

It has been found that there is a&nbsp;low mortality rate from ischemic heart disease among French people despite their high consumption of saturated fatty acids and the prevalence of other risk factors. The health-protective properties of wine are attributed to their antioxidant activity, i.e. the capability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, ROS. An imbalance between antioxidants and oxygen species results in oxidative stress leading to cellular damage. The phenolic compounds present in wine show beneficial physiological properties including protection against coronary heart disease, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic activity. Most of the beneficial effects of wine are attributed to the presence of flavonoids, resveratrol, phenolic acids and other antioxidants. This paper reviews the significance of different compounds present in wine and their effect on human health.</p><p>Chapter 1 focuses on flavonoids: flavonols, flavan-3-ols and anthocyanidins (Fig. 1) [14-29]. This class of compounds can exist both in a&nbsp;simple form, as aglycones, and bounded with sugars, as glycosides. The presence of phenolic hydroxyl group in these compounds is essential for their antioxidant activity and enables to scavenge free radicals in vivo.</p><p>Chapter 2 describes chemical and physicochemical properties of resveratrol (Fig. 2) [30-41] which is the main antioxidant in wine. Moreover, this compound has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoproteins and the aggregation of platelets [44-47]. Resveratrol also exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties [48, 49].</p><p>Chapter 3 reveals that wines are also a&nbsp;good source of other antioxidants [50-55] as phenolic acids (Fig. 3), tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol (Fig. 4), and also melatonin (Fig. 5).</p><p>Unfortunately, some wines can include mycotoxins, mainly ochratoxin a&nbsp;[59, 60] (Fig. 6), which is produced by the phytopatogenic fungi, Aspergillus carbonarius.</p><p>All types of red wine contain different amounts of ethanol and phenolic antioxidants, and therefore it is probable that the cardioprotective effect of red wine is caused by both these kinds of components [57-58]. Epidemiological observations, clinical and experimental in vitro research prove that regular and moderate intake of wine, particularly red wine, reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [66-70].</p>",

Popular and common drugs applied in anticancer therapy are characterized by low solubility and nonspecific biodistribution in an organism. The chemotherapy kills not only cancer but also healthy cells [4]. Building of modern drug delivery systems based on nanocarriers is a&nbsp;new method of anticancer treatment. The present study is directed towards nanomaterials (as carbon nanotubes, liposomes, polymeric micelles) as modern drug carriers. Thus, we characterized mechanisms of actions of traditional chemotherapeutics: paclitaxel, cisplatin and doxorubicin (Figs. 3-5) [1, 15, 21]. The purpose of this study is a&nbsp;description of the bioconjugation of drug-nanocarrier. Chemotherapeutics can be connected to external or internal surfaces of nanocarriers (Fig. 6) [6]. We described two main methods of drug delivery from internal space of nanocarriers: nanoextraction and nanocondensation (Fig. 7) [32]. The type of drug-carrier bonding can be covalent or noncovalent. We report recent advances in the field showing the formation of esters (Figs. 10-11) [28, 29, 53, 54], acethyl-hydrazone (Fig. 12) [55-61], amides [62-64], and disulfides groups [12, 65]. These reactions depend on functional groups in structures of drugs and require suitable modification of nanocarrier surfaces. In practice, the functionalization of nanocarrier surface is associated with the covering with polymers including PEG, HPMA, PG and PLGA [3]. Adsorption is the most popular process of bonding chemotherapeutic and nanomaterials (Fig. 13) [66]. Special attention is paid to electrostatic interaction between drugs: paclitaxel [74], cisplatin [59, 76, 77], doxorubicin [67-73] and nanocarriers: carbon nanotubes and/or polymeric micells. By application of modern anticancer therapy, drugs are preserved from lysosomal degradation and to fast reaction in biological environment. Finally, nanocarriers improve adsorption of drug and increase concentration of drug only in cancer tissues [6, 7].</p>",

In his book \"On the Physical Education of Children\" \u015aniadecki stated that exposition of a&nbsp;child's body to a&nbsp;direct action of sunlight is the most efficient method for the prevention and the cure of rickets (Illustrations 1 and 2). T. A. Palm in 1890 observed that the rickets is rare in countries where sunshine is abundant and prevalent whenever there is a&nbsp;little of sunlight. The first experimental evidence on the sunlight effects in rickets were presented by J. Raczy\u0144ski in 1912 who postulated that the sunlight affects metabolic processes in blood related to calcium transport (Illustration 3 and 4). E. Mellanby showed (1919) that the disease is connected to the lack of certain dietary factors and he recommended the use of cod liver - oil. K. Huldschinsky experimentally proved that UV irradiation cures the rickets. The Mellanby's and Huldschinsky's observations were confirmed by clinical studies in 1922.</p><p>E.V. McCollum has developed efficient methods for \"biological analysis\" of food and named anti-rachitic factor as vitamin D.H. Steenbock and A.F. Hess in 1924 found independently that various food products gain anti-rachitic properties after being irradiated with a&nbsp;UV lamp. A.F. Hees and A. Windaus showed that irradiation of ergosterol affords a&nbsp;product with high anti-rachitic activity.</p><p>In 1919 the first structure for cholesterol has been proposed by A. Windaus (Scheme 2, Fig. 3) and then with contribution of H. Wieland it was modified to the \"Wieland-Windaus\" structure (1928, Nobel Price lectures, Fig. 4). O. Diels' investigation on dehydratation of cholesterol (Fig. 5) and J.D. Bernal's crystallographic measurements of ergosterol challenged the Wieland-Windaus structure. Finally, the correct structure for cholic acid and sterols was deduced by O. Rosenheim and H. King (Fig. 6).</p><p>In 1932 crystalline vitamin D<sub>2</sub> was prepared in the Windaus laboratory (Scheme 3). In 1935 vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was isolated from a&nbsp;fish-oil and the same compound was synthesized from cholesterol (Illustration 5). The structure of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> was elucidated by Windaus in 1935 (Illustration 6) and confirmed by X-ray studies in 1948. Scientific contributions of Adolf Windaus are associated with his highest ethical standards and non-conformist political position in the national-socialist age.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>The Maya Blue is a&nbsp;famous blue pigment developed by pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica and manufactured there for about thousand years. It was applied for body decoration, important for cruel religious rituals, as well as for artistic paintings, murals, or coloration of ceramics. Its production was abandoned in XVII century and the procedure forgotten. The chemical nature of this blue pigment remained a&nbsp;puzzle for a&nbsp;long time and only in nineteen sixties it was revealed [1, 2] that it is a&nbsp;composite consisting of inorganic matrix (palygorskite) that accommodates molecules of organic dye - indigo. The preparation procedure was rediscovered [3] and the products analogous to classical Maya Blue could be obtained by simple thermal insertion of indigo into palygorskite (and also into sepiolite). However, the nature of chemical interaction between dye and matrix that provides very high resistibility of resulting pigments remains still not satisfactorily explained. The hydrogen bonds or coordinative interaction with matrix cations are taken into an account. Zeolites and other molecular sieves can be efficiently applied as matrices for pigments similar to Maya Blue. The coloration and other properties of pigments can be considerably changed by initial modification of zeolites with various cations, what supports an important role of complexes formed by dye molecules and zeolite cations. On the other hand, the zeolite-like materials AlPO4 as well as to some extent mesoporous silica (with some contribution of micropores) lacking any cations are also efficient matrices for pigments analogous to Maya Blue. Not only indigo, but also indigo derivatives (leucoindigo, thioindigo, indigo carmine) could be embedded inside the molecular sieves. The thermal insertion as well as crystallization of zeolites from gels supplemented with respective dye can be used for pigment synthesis. It is interesting that role of matrix can be also played by representative of novel MOF family of the molecular sieves.</p>",

Moreover, with the end of the human genome project and following expansion of the extensive genetic research an unprecedented number of new biological targets useful in drug design have been identified. Simultaneously, new methods such as combinatorial synthesis have expanded the overall size of chemical libraries and high-throughtput technologies have enabled to screen more than one million compounds a&nbsp;day [43]. However, an increasing size of chemical libraries in a&nbsp;random fashion may not necessary increase a&nbsp;probability of success and the overall number of successfully identified leads. Thus, success of any drug discovery program depend heavily on the assumed selection criteria of appropriate molecules [58] which properties should maximize the chances of identifying ligands for any given target. Selection criteria used for compounds to generate diverse as well as focused chemical libraries are briefly discussed in the present overview. We describe the most important quality factors such as size, diversity and chemical tractability which should be always kept in mind during the design of chemical libraries.</p><p>Chemical space is enormous and limited only by a&nbsp;chemist`s imagination. The number of possible drug-like molecules within chemical space has been estimated to be around 10<sup>60</sup> [17]. In contrast the overall number of atoms in the observable Universe is approximately 10<sup>80</sup>. It is obvious that it is impossible to synthesize every possible molecule so one need to explore only those regions of chemical space which are enriched with molecules of appropriate structure and function. Recent strategies for the design of high-quality collections of structurally diverse sets of small molecules are discussed in the context of probing the chemical space in order to find new biologically active structures.</p>",

The redefinition program, known as the New SI or the Quantum SI, draws on Maxwell's concept of replacing artifact standards with atomic standards, which are considered stable and available - at least in principle - to everybody, everywhere and at any time; the idea has been generalized and the present tendency is to define base units in terms of physical constants. Redefinition of the mole is a&nbsp;spin-off project associated with redefinition of the kilogram; two high-purity, 28Si-enriched silicon spheres were manufactured to make possible very accurate measurements of their parameters in order to determine (\"count\") the number of silicon atoms in each of the two spheres. Initially, the project has been designed to determine the Avogadro constant, with the intent to redefine the kilogram as the mass of an exactly specified number of atoms. Once the consensus had been reached that the kilogram should be defined by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant and the unit of mass should be realized with the use of the watt balance, the Avogadro project of silicon spheres was reinterpreted and became the basis for the redefinition and realization of the mole. In this paper, i&nbsp;discuss the origins of the Avogadro project (IAC), the physical principle of a&nbsp;very accurate measurement of the Avogadro constant and technical details of the realization of that project. The problem of resolving the discrepancy between results of the IAC and the watt balance project is reviewed. The current status of the IAC is discussed and difficulties with the proposed wording of the New SI redefinition of the mole are indicated. It is expected that all the technical problems can be resolved before the next meeting of the CGPM, where voting on implementation of the New SI is expected.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Deltorphin i&nbsp;(Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Asp-Val-Val-Gly-NH2) and dermorphin (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe--Gly-Tyr-Pro-Ser-NH2) are natural opioid peptides that have been isolated from the skin of South American frogs [1]. The presence of D-amino acid is crucial for their biological activity. The synthetic analogs of given heptapeptides containing L-alanine are not analgesics [2]. Analysis of the influence of stereochemistry on molecular packing, dynamics and biological functions of neuropeptides is still important for receptor studies and practical applications (e.g. design of new selective pain killers).\nPresented research is focused on the structure and dynamics of two N-terminal sequences of dermorphin: tripeptide Tyr-D-Ala-Phe 1, tetrapeptide Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly 2, and their analogs with L-alanine: Tyr-Ala-Phe 3 and Tyr-Ala-Phe-Gly 4, using solid state NMR and X-ray diffraction. This study clearly demonstrates that 1 and 2 crystallized under different conditions to form exclusively one structure [3, 4]. In contrast, tripeptide and tetrapeptide with L-Ala in the sequence very easily form different crystal modifications. Tyr-Ala-Phe 3 crystallizes into two forms: 3a and 3b [5], while Tyr-Ala-Phe-Gly 4 gives three modifications: 4a, 4b and 4c [4]. It seems that one of the factors, which can be important in the preorganization mechanism anticipating the formation of crystals, is the intramolecular CH-\u03c0 interaction between aromatic rings of tyrosine and/or phenylalanine and the methyl group of alanine. Such interaction is possible only for D-Ala residue. For L-Ala in the peptide sequence, the methyl group is aligned on the opposite side with respect at least to one of the aromatic groups. It can be further speculated that such internal CH-\u03c0 contacts can also occur during the interaction of ligand-receptor, making the message sequence of opioid peptides more rigid and finally selective. By employing different NMR experiments (e.g. PISEMA MAS and PILGRIM) it was proven that the main skeleton of analyzed peptides is rigid, whereas significant differences in the molecular motion of the aromatic residues were observed [4, 6]. Solid state <sup>2</sup>H NMR spectroscopy of samples with deuterium labeled aromatic rings: Tyr<sup>d4</sup>-D-Ala-Phe 5, Tyr-D-Ala-Phe<sup>d5</sup> 6, Tyr<sup>d4</sup>-Ala-Phe 7, Tyr-Ala-Phe<sup>d5</sup> 8 was used to analyze the geometry and time scale of the molecular motion. At ambient temperature, the tyrosine ring of sample 5 is rigid and in the sample 6 the phenylalanine ring undergoes a&nbsp;\"\u03c0-flip\". The tyrosine rings of form i&nbsp;of 7 and 8 are static, while the phenylalanine rings of form II of 7 and 8 undergo a&nbsp;fast regime exchange [6]. Variable temperature <sup>2</sup>H measurements proved that the tyrosine and phenylalanine rings of two forms of compounds 7 and 8 became more mobile with increasing temperature. In contrast, the aromatic rings of samples 5 and 6 preserve their dynamics regime (static tyrosine and \"\u03c0-flip\" phenylalanine) in a&nbsp;large range of temperatures [6].\nThe analysis of <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N labeled tetrapeptide Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly 2'-phospholipid membrane interactions suggests that peptide 2' is aligned on the surface of the membrane (RFDR MAS) and the sandwich-like \u03c0-CH<sub>3</sub>-\u03c0 arrangement of the pharmacophore is preserved (DARR) [7].</p>",

This is mainly connected with their usefulness as substrates to obtain complex compounds with various applications in different areas of science, industry and medicine [1-5]. Because of that many researchers are interested in methods of synthesis of such compounds. As the demand for derivatives with triple bonds is quite big and the one universal method of synthesis does not exist, the new ones are developed or these already known are improved. To enable choosing the best method for synthesis of acetylene derivatives, this review is presented. The oldest methods based on elimination reaction are mentioned [6-9], whereas those enabling incorporation of acetylene unit into more complicated compounds are described more thoroughly [10-92]. The latter methods based on homo- or heterocoupling lead to symmetrical [10-25] and unsymmetrical acetylene and bisacetylene derivatives [26-92]. The most popular reactions such as Glaser reaction (Scheme 1) [10-12], Cadiot-Chodkiewicz reaction (Schemes 11 and 12) [26-49], Hay reaction (Scheme 13) [13, 14] as well as Sonogashira-Hagihara reaction [50-69] and their modifications (Tab. 3) [57] are described. Moreover, the influence of main parameters such as type of substrate used, ratio of reagents, catalyst, base, solvent, reaction time and temperature on the reaction yield is presented (Tabs 1-4) [14, 18, 23, 25, 50-58, 69-78].</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Nanotechnology has attracted a&nbsp;great interest in recent years due to its expected impact on many areas such as energy, medicine, electronics and space industries. One of the most important aspects in researching nanotechnology is a&nbsp;synthesis of metal nanoparticles of well-defined sizes, shapes and controlled monodispersity. One of the exciting methods is the production of metal nanostructures using biological systems such as microbes, yeast, fungi and several plant extracts. Biological systems provide many examples of specifically modified nanostructured molecules. Perhaps, the best known are the magnetotactic bacteria which intracellularly synthesize magnetic nanocrystals in magnetosomes. The production of many other metal and metal alloy nanoparticles by organisms is a&nbsp;consequence of detoxification pathways. Organisms have evolved specific mechanisms to prevent excessive accumulation of metals. There are two probable ways to capture or trap the metal ions, electrostatic interaction and/or secretion of substances that will adhere the ions. For the process of intracellular synthesis of nanoparticles, the ions are involved in a&nbsp;nutrient exchange and/or substance diffusion. Thereafter, the functional reducing agents (i.e. reducing sugars, fatty acids, glutathione, flavonoids, terpenoids, fitochelatines etc.) and/or enzymes (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADP<sup>+</sup>- dependent reductases, hydrogenases, oxidases), convert the harmful ions into non-harmful matters. Finally, the nuclei grow and subsequently intracellularly or extracellularly accumulate to form nanoparticles. Despite numerous research made in this area, the mechanism of biosynthesis is not a&nbsp;fully understood. In this paper an overview of the use of living organisms in the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles is given and different mechanisms leading to the formation of nanoparticles are demonstrated.</p>",

The core is composed of four rings, each of them formed by seven subunits. The inner \u03b2-rings harbour active sites (in Eukaryota two of each kind: chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L), trypsin-like (T-L) and peptidylglutamyl (PGPH)). The outer, \u03b1-rings create a&nbsp;gated channel leading to the catalytic chamber [8]. In a&nbsp;latent proteasome the gate is closed by tightly packed N-terminal residues of ? subunits (Fig. 4).

            "abstract": "Explosives have a&nbsp;very rich history of its creation. This history dates back to the ninth century, when the Chinese invented a&nbsp;black powder. In the end of the twentieth century, the first nitroamine polycyclic cage structure was obtained. The representative of this group is 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaizowurtzitane (HNIW, Cl-20). HNIW has recently been the subject of an interest as one of the strongest explosive material.\nAs nitroamine, HNIW is compared to the other energetic materials: RDX i&nbsp;HMX [1, 2]. Researchers [5, 6] showed, that it is possible to replace a&nbsp;variety of typical explosives by HNIW and thanks to that obtain compositions with higher densities, heat of explosion and higher velocity of detonation.\nIn the published papers [7-13, 16] there were presented six polymorphs of HNIW: \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b5 with specific stabilities and structural characteristics.\nUnfortunately, there is no a&nbsp;direct method of obtaining HNIW. There are at least four steps needed to obtain HNIW. The first step is the synthesis of HBIW [20-22]. The next one is debenzylation reaction of HBIW [20-29] in order to remove the benzyl groups. The third step is removal of the two other benzyl groups and replace them by nitroso, formyl or acetyl groups [20, 24, 30, 32]. In the final step there is a&nbsp;nitration of HNIW precursors [31-37].\nThe HNIW seems to be a&nbsp;promising explosive and it can replace other currently used energetic materials. However, using HNIW is limited due to the complicated and expensive technology of its production. Therefore, research groups carried out new syntheses of HNIW to eliminated these problem.\nIn this article, review of the literature on the physicochemical properties and synthetic methods for HNIW were presented. The basic physical and explosive parameters of HNIW were summarized. The spatial structure was presented and polymorphs of HNIW were characterized. The methods for obtaining HNIW and intermediate products needed for its preparation were described. The methods of preparation of different HNIW polymorphs were also given.",

            "abstract": "High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an instrumental analytical technique, which is widely used for a&nbsp;separation and determination of a&nbsp;mixture of components in many samples (e.g. of biomedical, pharmaceutical, food, and environmental origin). Despite several decades of the development of this technique, some aspects of the chromatographic process are still open to questions. This is particularly related to mechanisms of retention and selectivity of a&nbsp;separation. Improvement of the separation selectivity can be achieved by a&nbsp;change of the stationary phase type and qualitative and/or quantitative composition of the mobile phase. The replacement of the stationary phase does not ensure a&nbsp;smooth change of selectivity and retention, however, it generates additional costs of analysis. Therefore, the optimal conditions of chromatographic separation can be easily obtained by the change of a&nbsp;composition of the mobile phase, i.e. the type and/or concentration of its modifier (organic solvent).\nThis paper presents an overview of approaches to explanation and interpretation of an influence of mobile phase composition on the retention and separation selectivity in liquid chromatography systems with particular emphasis on modifier type of eluent in the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC).",

Permeation of ions and small molecules through nanopores is common in biological systems. The first experiments where nanopores were used as single-molecule sensors were performed in the 90s [1, 2]. The detection principle is based on a&nbsp;monitoring of an ionic current passing through a&nbsp;nanopore as an electric field is applied across the membrane. Electrically charged particles (e.g. DNA) move in the electric field and block the ionic current as they pass through the nanopore. a&nbsp;sudden drop of the ionic current signals a&nbsp;single-molecule translocation event (Fig. 3-5). Nanopore sensors can give an information about the analyte: its size, structure and bonds stability. Today, a&nbsp;major topic of interest is the possibility of nanopore DNA sequencing.\nIn this work we present an introduction to nanopore technology and to current research related to potential nanopore applications. First, we describe biological and synthetic nanopores: their structure and methods of fabrication. Next, different modes of nanopore experiments are presented. In the third section, we focus on theoretical models and simulations of nanopores. Finally, we present future perspectives for applications with particular reference to DNA sequencing.",

            "abstract": "One of the oldest achievements of the human thought is the use of plants and plant extracts in therapeutics. Drugs of a&nbsp;plant origin are characterized by multi-effects. In recent years, much interest was directed at medicinal plants containing a&nbsp;mixture of biologically active substances with antimicrobial properties. In medicine, for many years have been used substances extracted from plants and their secondary metabolites and plant extracts, but now due to the development of organic chemistry, pharmacology and medicine, we can determine which biologically active substances produced by these plants are useful. Antimicrobial activity were described for selected groups of plant secondary metabolites, which potentially would allow their use as antimicrobial substances in medicines. These substances can be complementary to basic medical treatment, because their main advantage is a&nbsp;lower incidence of side effects. This paper presents an overview of research on antimicrobial properties of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, terpenoids and essential oils, phytosterols, and tannins and phenolic compounds. Examples of alkaloids active against strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis and E. coli are quindoline (1) and cryptolepine (2) which are components of an extract of Sida acuta [7]. Saal et al. described the effect of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (8) and daphnetin (9) isolated from Gingo biloba. These compounds are characterized by activity against strains of the genus S. aureus, E. coli and Salmonella entertidis [5]. Apigenin (15) and amentoflavone (16) have a&nbsp;strong activity against pathogenic fungi Candida albicans, S. cerevisiae, and T. beigelii. Terpenoids are potent phorbol esters (21-26), dustanine (27), 15-acetoxydustaine (28), cycloartenole (29) [14]. Several phytosterols has antibacterial activity [2, 5, 48]. The examples might be: stigmasterol (36), \u03b8-sitosterol (37), epidoxysterol (38) isolated from Morinda citrifolia (Rubiaceae), which were characterized by strong activity against Mycobacterium intracellulare [5]. Many authors reported that the tannins and phenolic compounds were characterized by antimicrobial activity [49-53]. Natural substances that inhibit the growth of microorganisms are becoming an alternative to synthetic compounds, as this literature review confirms it.",

The interaction between cosmetic ingredient and skin cells determines efficiency of the product. The study presents the most important functions of the skin outlayer (stratum corneum), its structure (Fig. 1) and permeability [1-7]. Due to the compact structure, stratum corneum prevents skin water loss. Moreover, it protects human body from outer substances influence [8-12]. Relationship between compound properties and its ability to skin absorption was also described. Physicochemical properties like lipophilicity, compound structure and particle size have a&nbsp;significant influence on intensity of the compounds skin penetration [4, 16-25]. Lipophilicity of a&nbsp;molecule is defined using many theoretical and experimental methods which allow to predict cosmetic ingredients assimilation [26-42]. Moreover, cosmetic base composition [43-47] and the presence of the penetration enhancers (promotors) also affect active ingredients absorption through the skin [48-49].\nThe most popular equipment used for testing the absorption and the penetration of active substances through the human skin are described in the last part of the manuscript. Compounds permeability through the skin could be tested using various experimental methods [50-58] including the diffusion cells equipped with membranes or prepared skin fragments [37, 55, 64-67]. The most common used are Franz diffusion cells (Fig. 4) and flow diffusion cell (Fig. 5). The measurement of permeation through stratum corneum using ATR-FTIR method is quite reliable and simple (Fig. 8), although measuring skin penetration is made by Saarbrucken penetration model (Fig. 6) and by application of Tape Stripping technique (Fig. 7). The study of skin absorption mechanisms and factors influencing this process is a&nbsp;great opportunity to design efficient cosmetic recipes and a&nbsp;possibility to make more effective, active cosmetic ingredients.",

            "abstract": "Cinchona alkaloids comprising quinine, quinidine, cinchonidine and cinchonine as the major members constitute a&nbsp;unique class of quinoline alkaloids with tremendous impact on human civilization (Section 1). The odyssey of Cinchona alkaloids began with the discovery of their antimalarial properties followed by antiarrhytmic action of quinidine. Currently medicinal chemistry of Cinchona alkaloids derivatives develops rapidly and many other activities such as cytotoxic, multidrug resistance inhibitory have been demonstrated (Section 5) [5]. Beside medicine Cinchona alkaloids gave also the fundaments of stereochemistry and asymmetric synthesis. An extraordinary catalytic potency of parent and modified Cinchona alkaloids (deserving privileged catalyst classification) include more than 50 types of diverse stereoselective reactions, with few spectacular such as asymmetric dihydroxylation of alkenes or heterogeneous \u03b1-ketoesters hydrogenation (Section 3) [3]. Last but not least the portfolio of applications of Cinchona alkaloids includes resolution of racemates by diastereomeric crystallization or by the use of Cinchona-based chiral stationary phases for ion-exchange enantioselective chromatography and other recognition or sensing systems (Section 4)[166]. Easy transformation of Cinchona alkaloids (for example by click chemistry) into other chiral and modular building blocks together with current pressure on a&nbsp;more intense exploration of sustainable products make cinchona alkaloids of primary importance for modern synthetic, catalytic and medicinal chemistry. The aim of this review which covers over 200 references is to briefly summarize all aspects of Cinchona alkaloid chemistry and biology with the special emphasis on new applications.",

            "abstract": "The tartaric acid and its salts have been present in chemistry for almost 350 years, since Pierre Seignette isolated Rochelle salt in 1675. Since that time tartaric acid and its derivatives have been often used in chemistry due to their accessibility, enantiopurity, relatively low cost and presence of different functional groups which easily allow to modify the molecule. Many tartaric acid derivatives serve as catalysts in important stereoselective transformations such as Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation or asymmetric Rousch aryloboronation. In many others reactions tartaric acid have been employed as a&nbsp;chiral building block for natural products synthesis, highly functionalized molecules or ligand design such as well known TADDOL or its analogues. Its polar functional groups allow to form crystals with amines and aminoalcohols what is widely used for their enantiopurification and resolution. The relatively new subdiscipline is the use of tartaric acid in chiral recognition and chiral discrimination in nanochemistry and enantioselective chromatography. The other, recent applications of tartaric acid include functionalization of metal layers, antibacterial and antifungal activity among many others. The significance of tartaric acid is evident - since 2000, words \"tartaric acid\" or \"tartrates\" can be found in databases over four thousand times. Taking that into account this short review is concentrated on selected applications of tartaric acid and its derivatives in organic chemistry in recent several years.",

            "abstract": "One of the fundamental research goals in modern chemistry is the development of efficient and selective procedures to access organic compounds. Among all of the methodologies developed so far, catalysis offers an efficient and economical approach to enantiomericaly pure substances. In particular, transition metal catalysts modified by ligands, usually phosphines, are one of most successful examples of practical catalysis. Unfortunately, most of the applied metals (e.g., Pd, Rh, Ru, Ir) are low abundant, toxic and expensive. For this reason, recent research is focusing on their replacement by cheaper and low toxic metals. For example, the use of zinc can be of great interest, due to its abundance (0.0076% in the earth crust), biological relevance and distinct abilities. In the last two decades many scientific group have been working on finding new, high efficient and inexpensive catalytic system based on zinc for enantioselective transformations. It has been found that many of important organic reactions (for example aldol, Diels-Alder, Friedel-Crafts, Henry reactions) in their asymmetric version can be catalyzed by zinc complexes. One of them is also asymmetric reduction of double carbon-heteroatom bonds through addition of hydride (from silane). Hydrosilylation reduction is a&nbsp;promising alternative for the catalytic transformation of organic molecules to other reduction methods such as: hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation owing to its operational simplicity and mild conditions. This review will give a&nbsp;general overview of the possible applications of zinc-catalyzed hydrosilylation of carbonyl compounds and imines. Since the understanding of mechanism of reaction is crucial for rational planning of new and more efficient ligands, some part of this article was devoted for mechanical considerations.",

This article focuses on these last-mentioned methods, which can be a&nbsp;source of information on energy heterogeneity of the catalyst or adsorbent surface.\nHeterogeneity is usually determined by measuring adsorption isotherms of a&nbsp;selected adsorbate on the examined adsorbent, which is dependent of adsorbate coverage on the adsorbent relative to the equilibrium pressure under isothermal conditions.\nAmong the many mathematical models describing this relationship particularly interesting is the adsorption isotherm model described by generalized integral Fredholm equation. The solution of this equation is density function with the assumed local isotherm model. There are different ways to solve the Fredholm equation, depending on measurement methods of obtained adsorption isotherms. For example, an application of static techniques (gravimetric or volumetric) needs to use advanced, sophisticated numerical methods for directly solving integral equations, other techniques (e.g. such as calorimetric or chromatographic) provide specific values that simplify these calculations. The resulting energy density function allows to observe active centers as peaks or inflections of the curve on the energy spectrum graph.",

Further, the most important requirements for medical applications are given. Those are: high relaxivity, charge-osmolality, stability, toxicity via potential transmetallation of redox activity [42].

The cyclocondensation of an appropriate o-phenylenediamine with cyanogen bromide affords high yields of 2-aminobenzimidazoles [12]. Hydrogenation of o-cyanaminonitrobenzene over Raney nickel catalyst gives 2-aminobenzimidazole [34, 35].

On the other hand, it gives arguments for a&nbsp;cultivation of \"impractical\" sciences.\nThe article describes the earliest attempts to present simple organic formulas undertaken by Couper and Kekul\u00e9. Examples of a&nbsp;transformation of aromatic compounds present how results of derivatization led to conclusions concerning structures. Experiments and logic line of thought was supported by a&nbsp;great intuition. More complicated molecules were investigated by degradation reactions. For example, A. Baeyer at the beginning of his investigations concerning indigo, subjected isatin (obtained from indigo by oxidation) to different reducing reagents. He obtained indoldiol, oxindole, indole etc. Then these relatively simple compounds were synthesized and served as by-products for indigo. Some methods of the industrial production of indigo were elaborated on the base of works of Baeyer [16-20]. Similarly, the structures of chrysin, brazilin and haematoxilin have been resolved mainly by their degradation. The final structures were confirmed by synthesis.",

Therefore, this type of biotransformation is known as enantioselective enzymatic desymmetrization (EED) [1-11]. This method is related to the generation of an asymmetry (loss of symmetry elements) in prochiral molecules (most often an sp3 or sp2 hybridized carbon atom), in meso synthones, and centrosymmetric compounds. An achiral center of the tetrahedral system is defined as a&nbsp;prochiral one if it becomes chiral as a&nbsp;result of one of the two substituents replacement which, when separated from the particles, are indistinguishable (Scheme 1, 2) [1-4, 9, 12].\nAsymmetric synthesis is enantioselective when one of the enantiotopic groups or faces of an optically inactive compound is biotransformed faster than the other (Scheme 3-5) [1, 10, 11, 13-15].\nLipases are enzymes of highest importance in stereoselective organic synthesis, mainly due to their exceptionally broad substrate tolerance, stability, activity in unphysiological systems, and relatively low price [9, 14]. The mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis catalysed by hydrolases is similar to that observed in the chemical hydrolysis with the use of base. The selectivity of enzymatic catalysis depends on the substrate orientation in the enzyme active site (Scheme 6, 7) [25-29].\nLipases were successfully used for the desymmetrization of different prochiral diesters, alcohols and amines. Most lipases preferentially convert the same prochiral groups in the above mentioned types of reaction. This allows the preparation of the both enantiomers of the product in high chemical and optical yield (Scheme 9-13) [9, 13, 32-56].",

One of such solutions is an use of a&nbsp;multilevel and cheap catalyst. Proline used as a&nbsp;catalyst is a&nbsp;substance of natural origin which was synthetically obtained by Willst\u00e4tter who was carrying out research on hygric acid (Scheme 1) [10]. The cells of many organisms have a&nbsp;suitable enzymatic system essential for proline biosynthesis [15]. So far, three proline biosynthesis pathways have been described: from glutamate (Scheme 3 and 4), ornithine (Scheme 5 and 6), and arginine (Scheme 7) [16-28]. Proline which is obtained as a&nbsp;result of biosynthesis or supplementation is a&nbsp;substrate for many proteins. Characteristic and significant content (about 23%) of this amino acid was observed in collage. In cells proline can play an important role of osmoregulator [31-35] - a&nbsp;protective substance regulating the activity of such enzymes as catalase and peroxidase [36]. Proline as a&nbsp;secondary amine shows exceptional nucleophilicity facilitating imine and enamine formation. Used as a&nbsp;catalyst in aldol reaction makes with substrates like imine or enamine transition state imitating the activity of naturally occurring enzymes for this type of reaction, that is aldolases. In their research Hajos and Parrish, and Eder, Sauer and Wiechert used proline in intramolecular aldol reaction obtaining proper enones (Scheme 9) [60-62]. The process of intramolecular aldol reaction was used for a&nbsp;separation of racemic mixture of diketones (Scheme 10) [63, 64], cyclization of ortho-substituted aromatic aldehydes and ketones (Scheme 11) [65], synthesis of cyclic diketones (Scheme 13) [68] and domino reaction to obtain substituted cyclohexanones from beta-diketones and unsaturated ketones (Scheme 14) [69].",

This reaction allows formation of s not only carbon-oxygen bond, but also carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-sulphur to be synthesized. The Mitsunobu reaction is widely applied in organic synthesis as a&nbsp;way of inversion of configuration of secondary alcohols or of aryl ethers synthesis. Numerous studies bring the accounts of using this reaction for the synthesis of steroids, carbohydrates, nucleosides, as well as alkaloids and other heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen. The popularity of this reaction lies in its stereoselectivity and compatibility with a&nbsp;wide range of functional groups as well as in its moderate requirements considering reaction conditions.

They exhibit interesting antifungal, antiemetics and anticancer properties. To synthesize these products, the construction of the N-acylphosphoramidate linkages seems to be a&nbsp;key step. Many groups have described the preparation of such a&nbsp;type of analogues but none of those methods was general. Grandas has for the first time reported the synthesis, of N-acylphosphoramidate peptide-oligonucleotide hybrids via condensation of N-phosphitylated carboxyamides with alcohols in the presence of 1H-tetrazole [9]. Based on this strategy Sekine synthesized aminoacyl adenylate (aa-AMP) analogues which could be useful in the studies on the recognition mechanism of the aminoacylation of tRNA and other biochemical reactions [10]. Since aa-AMPs are extremely unstable under aqueous conditions more stable analogues were required. Aminoacyl-adenylate analogues having an N-acylphosphoramidate linkage (aa-AMPN) could behave as potent, selective asparagine synthetase (AS) inhibitors because of its structural similarity to \u03b2-aspartyl-AMP (\u03b2AspAMP) which is natural product of AS [17].\nAmong natural N-acylphosphormiadates, Phosmidosine which connects a&nbsp;nucleoside analogue, 8-oxoadenosine, with an L-proline residue is unique because of its significant antitumor activities and property of stopping cell growth at the G1 phase in the cell cycle (Fig. 2) [2, 13]. The main difficulty during the synthesis of this compound is an extreme instability under weak basic conditions which excludes the use of labile protecting group of basic properties [14]. Stability studies have shown that under basic conditions phosphoryl group of Phosmidosine underwent rapid N-N migration (Scheme 9) [16]. Many modifications have been introduced to improve Phosmidosine properties [16]. Analogues such as demethylated species (Phosmidosine B) have proven to be stable under both basic and acid conditions and are also potential candidates for antitumor drugs [14].",

Pulvinic and vulpinic acids exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activity [1-3]. Paraconic acids have anticancer and antibacterial activity [4, 5]. The interesting biological activities i.a. antileukemic, anti-HIV and cytostatic, have been found for dibenzyl-\u03b3-lactones [8].\nThis review covers some examples of synthetic and biotechnological methods leading to either racemic or optically active \u03b3-lactones with aromatic substituents. The racemic \u03b1-benzylidene lactones can be produced from Baylis-Hillman acetates [9]. The multicomponent synthesis of the paraconic acid analogs is performed by a&nbsp;fourfold metallation-conjugate addition-aldol addition-intramolecular transesterification sequence [4]. Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is the key step in the synthesis of asymmetric pulvinic acids [1]. Some other examples of synthetic strategies involving the reactivity of ylides, vicinal dianions, ozonolysis or Claisen rearrangement are also presented [10-13].\nProduction of optically active \u03b3-lactones with aromatic substituents involves application of biotechnological and chemical methods. The first one includes using commercially available enzymes [16, 17] or whole cells of microorganisms [18-20]. Chemical methods involve application of chiral starting materials like malic acid esters or the derivatives of succinic acid [14, 15] or chiral catalysts like BINAP-Rh or Ru complexes [7].",

ILs with long alkyl chains and pronounced hydrophilic and lipophilic molecular fragments have an obvious amphiphilic nature and are called the surface active ionic liquids, SAILs, because they show combined properties of ILs and surfactants [6].<p></p>Recently, there is ever-increasing interest in SAILs based on gemini surfactants (Figs 6 and 7 [21, 22]), dodecyl sulfate, DS (Fig. 8a) and aerosol-OT, AOT (Fig. 8b) anions [23-25], alkylpyridinium (Fig. 1b [11]), imidazolium (Figs 1a and 3 [13, 14, 16]), alkylpyrrolidinium [17, 18], and diisopropylethylammonium, DIPEA [19] cations. Apart from SAILs, in recent years an attention has also been paid to functionalized surfactants such as: bolaform surfactants [32], supra-long chain surfactants [35, 36], calixarene-based surfactants (Fig. 9 [33]). Surfactants of the above types of SAILs and functionalized surfactants have been synthesized and their micellar structures formed in water have been studied. For example, very interesting vesicle systems were observed in aqueous solutions of diisopropylethylamine alkyl carboxylates, [DIPEA]<sup>+</sup>[C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>COO]<sup>-</sup>, for n = 3-9 (Fig. 5 [19]) and in aqueous solutions of the surfactant mixture composed of N-dodecyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium and sodium dodecyl sulfate (Fig. 4 [18]). It was found that 1-hexadecyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride in aqueous solutions underwent the phase (micellar) transformations upon cooling (Fig. 2 [13]).</p><p>An important group of polymeric surfactants attracting a&nbsp;great interest in literature is that of triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO), often abbreviated as [EO]<sub>a</sub>-[PO]<sub>b</sub>-[EO]<sub>a</sub>. Recently, these copolymers, also called poloxamers, have been proposed for pharmaceutical use [37-40]. These nonionic surfactants form micelles in aqueous solutions with a&nbsp;core containing the hydrophobic PO blocks and a&nbsp;shell made up of the hydrated EO blocks [41]. The subject of current studies include: the interactions between poloxamers and anionic surfactant, SDS in aqueous solutions [42-47], micellization of poloxamers in mixtures of water and organic solvents [48], comparison of association properties of diblock and triblock copolymers [49].</p><p>The paper also presents the experimental methods used recently to study surface activity, aggregation behaviors, and micellar structures of surfactants in water.</p>",

As potential drugs ONs are employed in the antisense strategy [1]. The antisense therapeutic agent acts on the pathogenic mRNA causing inactivation of the target.

To improve some properties of antisense oligonucleotides plethora of chemical modifications introduced within both sugar unit and internucleotides linkage were investigated.</p><p>Among numerous ONs modified in internucleotide phosphodiester bond, one of the most interesting are oligonucleotide phosphoramidates (NP-oligos) in which one of the bridging oxygens is replaced by nitrogen atom (at 3' or 5' position). Hence, two classes of compounds are formed: oligonucleotide-(N5'\u2192P3')phosphoramidates and oligonucleotide(N3'\u2192P5')-phosphoramidates. These compounds, similar to native DNA and RNA, possess an achiral phosphorous atom and all internucleotides bonds are negatively charged. Additionally, NP-oligo shows good resistance to nucleolyticdegradation and can bind to the target DNA or RNA with high affinity [12]. In literature several synthetic strategies concerning both (N5'\u2192P3') and (N3'\u2192P5') NP-oligos have been described. Some of them allowed to obtain only corresponding dimers.</p><p>In the light of recent discoveries the most promising candidates for therapeutic and diagnostic applications are oligonucleotide-(N3'\u2192P5')thiophosphoramidates.

Human telomerase (TA) is a&nbsp;reverse transcriptase ribonucleoprotein that synthesizes de novo d-(TTAGGG)n repeats at chromosomal DNA ends. Whereas activity of this enzyme is observed in ~85% of all human tumors, most of normal somatic cells either lack TA activity or express it only at low levels. For these reasons TA constitute an attractive and nearly universal anticancer target for rational drug development.</p>",

            "abstract": "Proline in organic synthesis is used as a&nbsp;small molecular organocatalyst. In a&nbsp;catalytic act proline, similarly to an enzyme, activates reagents, stabilizes transition state and influences an orientation of substrates [1-12]. Proline works as aldolase i&nbsp;(so called microaldolase I). In comparison with other amino acids it shows exceptional nucleophilicity which makes imines and enamines formation easier.\nIn the intermolecular aldol reaction proline was used for the first time by List and co-workers (Scheme 1) [3, 9, 20]. Since then an immense progress has been observed in this field. Several aldolization reactions were performed in the presence of proline. Reactions of this type proceed between the donor (nucleophile) and the acceptor (electrophile).\nIn aldol reaction the donors can be both ketones and aldehydes which next are condensed with ketones and aldehydes acting as electrophiles (Scheme 2-18; Tab. 1-7) [21-72]. The presence of proline ensures not only high yield of homo- and heteroaldolization but mainly enables conducting enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis. Intermolecular proline-catalyzed aldol condensation proceeds according to enamine mechanism. Anti-aldols, which make a&nbsp;valuable source of intermediates in the synthesis of important biologically active compounds, are mainly obtained in this reaction [35-44, 54, 58, 62, 63, 68, 69, 71].",

There are six structural isomers depending on the position of the nitrogen atoms. The isomer [4,5-d] does not contain the bridge-head nitrogen and can be considered as 7-thio analogue of the natural purine bases such as guanine and adenine. Due to the great of their biological potential the newly synthesized compounds are evaluated for various pharmacological activities. This review presents numerous thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine derivatives reported for their interesting biological activity including antibacterial [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 19], antifungal [2-6, 9, 10], antiviral [11-13], analgesic [18, 19], antidepressant [17] and anticancer properties [23-26]. Some urea and thiourea derivatives exhibited significant antiparkinsonian activity [14-16]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promotes an inflammatory response, which in turn causes many of the clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders. Ethyl 4-(2-amino-5,7-dioxo-3,4,5,7-tetrahydro-thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-6(2H)-yl)butanoate derivatives 29 (Fig. 24) as a&nbsp;TNF\u03b1 inhibitors have a&nbsp;potential use in the treatment of diseases such as refractory asthma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and other [21]. Blocade of the CXCR2 receptor by thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2(3H)-ones also represents an attractive strategy for treatment of inflammatory diseases [20]. Recently there have been developed CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of multiple sclerosis [22]. Isatoribine, 5-amino-3-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-3H-thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2-one (20) (Fig. 15) is a&nbsp;small molecule toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist and an activator of innate immunity. Its orally bioavailable analogue ANA 975 (Fig. 16) has been reported for probable use in treating disease states associated with abnormal cell growth, such as cancer and has anti HCV activity [13]. Thiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidines inhibit the growth of the weeds which implies that they have a&nbsp;potential as herbicides [27].",

            "abstract": "Platinum drugs belong to one of the oldest [2] and best investigated groups of cytotoxic drugs. On account of their high efficacy and alkylating-like action [14] they are used in a&nbsp;treatment of various types of neoplasms [3-5]. Despite investigators' best efforts survival time of patients diagnosed with cancer is still short. Responsible for the fact is high toxicity of used therapeutic methods and development of resistance to them [3-5, 19]. In this paper authors review reasons behind decreased sensitivity of neoplastic cells to platinum treatment and discuss the newest promising trends in its overcoming.\nDue to different properties of neoplastic cells, availability of a&nbsp;chemotherapeutic agent inside a&nbsp;tumour is limited [9-12]. Moreover continuous development of resistance to platinum drugs further decreases their cellular concentration and inactivates their functions. Also owing to increased activity of DNA repair systems, higher tolerance to genome deformations and numerous mechanisms that lead to impaired apoptosis, drug efficacy is reduced [3-5, 19].\nIn order to increase a&nbsp;potency of platinum agents new therapeutic strategies are investigated. Coadministration with resistance modulators [20, 22, 23] and combination therapy with other antineoplastic drugs [8, 24-30] have already proved their effectiveness. Additionally, newer generations of platinum drugs are developed [15-18]. Mostly platinum(IV) prodrug complexes often releasing axial ligands with their own pharmacological action [5, 6, 31], but also multi-nuclear platinum compounds that form more complex DNA-adducts [32-35]. Other strategies include the development of innovative dosage forms such as single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [38, 39] or encapsulation [36, 37]. Finally utilisation of oncolytic viruses could be a&nbsp;way to selectively destroy neoplastically transformed cells [40].",

Its worldwide consumption is second only to water [1-3]. The tea is not only important because of its popularity but also due to its beneficial influence on human health [4]. The biological benefits of tea are due to their flavanol content[5-13]. Tea flavanols are a&nbsp;group of natural polyphenols (Fig. 2). Therapeutic effects of tea have been extensively examined in many in vitro and in vivo tests. It was confirmed that tea leaves ingredients have antibacterial, antifungial, antiviral properties, they also prevent cell mutations and they inhibit progress of heart diseases. Moreover, tea can stimulate neural system and regulate its functions [14-20]. All this activities are mostly due to antioxidant ability of tea polyphenols (Fig. 4).\nTea production process can be run in different ways and this affects of the tea taste, aroma, colour and antioxidants content. According to fermentation degree, different tea kinds can be obtained (Fig. 1). During the manufacturing process of black and oolong teas, tea leaves are crushed to allow polyphenol oxidase to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of catechins to polymers called theaflavins and thearubigins (Fig. 3) [21-23]. Green or white teas are obtained through shorter fermentation, so the catechin concentration remains higher. Tea is prepared by infusing tea leaves in hot water. Brewing process conditions like temperature, brewing time, pH, besides other factors has a&nbsp;significant influence on polyphenols content [24-32]. Many studies have determined total flavonoids content and antioxidant activity according to different tea type and brewing conditions, tea plantation type or fermentation process. The amount of total polyphenol was determined using the F-C method, catechins, caffeine and polyphenolic acids were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with reversed phase. Obtained results let compare how different production and brewing processes affect the tea quality [33-56].",

Reactions of this type were carried out in the presence of different catalysts [3-10], however in recent years a&nbsp;lot of attention has been paid to enantioselective Mannich reaction catalyzed with proline. Such reactions were carried out with the use of different compounds containing carbonyl group and the most frequently used amine was p-anisidine. The advantage of the use of p-anisidine is a&nbsp;possibility of conducting the direct Mannich reaction (Scheme 3). In this way \u03b2-amino ketones (Tab. 1, 2, 4) [15, 18-20, 23, 24], \u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-amino ketones (Tab. 3) [15, 22], and \u03b2-amino alcohols (Tab. 5, 6) [25, 26] were obtained.\nA possibility of syntheses of \u03b2-amino sugars and \u03b1-amino acids with their derivatives (Tab. 7) [28, 29] is worth noticing. In a&nbsp;great number of described reactions, the products were obtained with satisfactory yield and enantiomeric excess. Taking into consideration the difficulty of a&nbsp;removal of p-hydroxyphenyl group which protects amine group in the resulting products, the attempts of using different amine compounds in Mannich reactions catalyzed with proline were undertaken. The use of amines blocked by tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc) enabled to obtain the products with high yield and ee values (Tab. 12-15) [35-38]. However in the case of the use of Boc the reaction must be carried out in an indirect way (it is necessary to prepare imine blocked by Boc earlier).",

            "abstract": "In recent years there has been a&nbsp;dynamic development of asymmetric synthesis. Groups of researchers, particularly the one led by Benjamin List and Carlos Barbas, carried out a&nbsp;number of reactions and showed the effectiveness of the use of small organic molecules such as proline as catalysts. Michael addition catalyzed with proline is a&nbsp;particularly interesting reaction because it can be carried out in two aminocatalytic pathways. The analysis of Michael reaction reveals potential for both forms of aminocatalysis: enamine and iminium catalysis (Scheme 1) [1-14]. Presumably Michael reaction proceeds mainly according to enamine mechanism. The use of proline in Michael reaction with imine activated acceptor is slightly effective. So far the researches have shown that the modification of proline molecule or addition of other catalyst is necessary for condensation to appear. Enamine catalysis concerns the activation of carbonyl compound in situ being a&nbsp;donor. There is no need for enolase anion to be created earlier [2, 15-17]. When, as a&nbsp;result of the reaction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound with proline, Michael acceptor activation appears it means that it is enamine mechanism reaction (Scheme 1) [2, 24]. One of the first examples of direct Michael reaction proceeding through enamine transition state is the reaction of cyclopentanone with nitrostyrene (Scheme 6) [20-23]. Other examples of Michael addition of ketone with nitro olefin catalysed by proline are shown in table 2 and 3 [10, 23, 30]. Nitroketones obtained in that way are useful as precursors for different organic compounds [33], also pyrrolidines [34]. Pyrrolidines are pharmacologically active and they selectively block presynaptic dopamine receptors [34] (Scheme 7).\nExcept for Michael intermolecular reaction, intramolecular condensation adducts were also obtained. Michael intramolecular proline-catalyzed condensation in which inactive ketones transform into \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds was described (Scheme 9) [35, 36]. These reactions require a&nbsp;stoichiometric amount of a&nbsp;catalyst and a&nbsp;long time of reaction and they give as a&nbsp;result a&nbsp;little enantiomeric excess [11, 24, 35].\nIn 1991, Yamaguchi and co-workers carried out malonates Michael addition to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by L-proline [24, 39]. The reaction proceeded according to enamine mechanism, for example dimethyl malonate was reacted with hex-2-enal in the presence of proline to give Michael adduct in 44% yield. To improve the yield an attempt of a&nbsp;slight modification of a&nbsp;proline molecule was made transforming it into proper salt. Proline lithium salt enabled to obtain the condensation product in 93% yield (Tab. 4). Regardless of a&nbsp;used catalyst the products in the form of racemates were obtained.\nIn order to improve enantioselective properties of a&nbsp;catalyst, Michael addition of diisopropyl malonate to cycloheptenone was carried out in chloroform in the presence of different proline salts. Optimal enantioselectivity and yield was obtained by using rubidium salt (Tab. 5-7) [40, 41].\nRubidium prolinate-catalyzed Michael additions are used in industry e.g. for enantioselective synthesis of the selective serotonine reuptake inhibitior (SSRI) (-)-paroxetine (antidepressant) (Scheme 12) [24].",

One of the larger groups amongst them are terpenoid compounds, either the structurally simplest monoterpenoids, or sesquiterpenoids containing several atoms or even di- and triterpenoids composed of several carbon atoms. Many of these compounds contain lactone moiety in their structure [1-27]. Equally often, a&nbsp;component of their structure is a&nbsp;hydroxyl group [1-23]. Sometimes, the structural element can also be a&nbsp;halogen atom [24-27]. Many of the hydroxylactones exhibit interesting biological properties, such as antimicrobial (Fig. 1, 2, 12, 13), [2, 3, 19, 21], cytotoxic (Fig. 4, 6, 8), [8, 12, 14], anti-inflammatory (Fig. 1, 4, 11, 14), [3, 9, 18, 22], anti-fungal (112 Fig. 13), [19, 21] or liver protection (Fig. 4, 9) [8, 15]. Some of these compounds also exist as flavoring or taste agents in food (Fig. 3, 10), [7, 16], inhibitors of overproduction nitrogen sulfide (5, 6, 11), [10, 12, 18] or pesticides (Fig. 2, 13), [6, 20]. Hydroxylactones are usually isolated from plants, in many cases, those that are used in traditional folk medicine (Fig. 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17), [1, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26], and sometimes from the other organisms, such as microorganisms or fungi (Fig. 2, 5), [6, 10]. Lactones that contain a&nbsp;chlorine atom in their structure, in addition to or instead of the hydroxy group usually have cytotoxic properties (16, 17), [15, 25, 27]. They are found in both land-based plants, mainly belonging to the family Asteraceae (Fig. 17) [25-27] as well as in marine organisms (Fig. 16), [24], in which the presence of chlorine atoms can be a&nbsp;result of the presence of salt (chloride) in seawater.

            "abstract": "Quinolinium and pyridinium salts belong to the group of onium compounds and are widely used in organic, structural and analytical chemistry. Their synthesis is mainly based on quaternization of the nitrogen atom in a&nbsp;heterocyclic ring [4, 13, 23]. In analytical chemistry quinolinium and pyridinium salts such as 2-chloro-1-methylquinolinium tetrafluoroborate (CMQT) or 1-benzyl-2-chloropyridinium bromide (BCPB) perform very well as thiol specific derivatization reagents in terms of derivatization reaction velocity, stability, chromatographic properties of the derivatives, and thus, amenability to automatization [18-22, 32-42]. Analytical procedures for thiol determination usually involve reduction of disulfide bonds with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, tri-n-butylphosphine or mercaptoethanol, chemical derivatization of the sulfur compound with the use of 2-halopyridinium or 2-haloquinolinium salts and then deproteinization, followed by ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC or CE separation and spectrophotometric detection. Derivatization reaction takes advantage of great susceptibility of quinolinium or pyridinium molecules at 2-position to nucleophilic displacement, and a&nbsp;high nucleophilicity of the thiol group. Derivatization reaction mixture is usually ready to be analyzed just after mixing of the substrates. CMQT and BCPB exhibit very high reactivity toward thiols [44, 45], sulfides [63] as well as thiosulfates [40, 54]. 2-S-quinolinium and 2-S-pyridinium derivatives possess advantageous spectrophotometric and chromatographic properties. They are stable and more hydrophobic than thiols themselves, possessing a&nbsp;well-defined absorption maximum in the UV region. The reaction is accompanied by an analytically advantageous bathochromic shift from reagent maximum to the maximum of the derivative. Thanks to this phenomenon it is possible to use a&nbsp;large excess of derivatization reagent in order to drive the reaction to completion and avoid a&nbsp;huge signal of unreacted compound on the chromatogram [26]. Elaborated with the use of onium salts methods have proven to be useful in quantitative HPLC and CE analysis of endogenous and exogenous low-molecular-weight biological thiols in human body fluids, plant extracts and some groceries [44, 45].",

            "abstract": "Opioids are the oldest drugs know to humanity, which have been and continue to be used for the treatment of chronic pain. Unfortunately they have a&nbsp;large numbers of side effects [1-6]. Three main types of opioid receptors \u03bc (MOR), \u03b4 (DOR) and \u03ba (KOR) are known [8]. The ORL1 receptor was classified as the fourth member of opioid receptor family [9]. Opioid receptors can form homodimers and the following heterodimers: DOR-KOR, DOR-MOR and KOR-MOR [13c,d,f, 14].\nSpecially designed ligands which are able to penetrate the BBB are used to study physiological consequences of opioid receptor homo- and heterodimerization, and as new analgesics.\nBivalent ligands are defined as compounds that contain two pharmacophoric units, an appropriately designed spacer to separate and define the two pharmacophores, and a&nbsp;linker unit to connect the pharmacophores, to the spacer (Fig. 1) [16].\nThe affinity of a&nbsp;ligand to its target depends on its fundamental kinetic association and dissociation rate constants (Scheme 1) [24]. Bivalent ligands interacting with the opioid receptors have been divided into three groups: nonpeptide, peptide-nonpeptide and peptide homo- or heterodimers. Nonpeptide bivalent ligands (4-21, 27-41 and 44-45) containing different pharmacophores (selective opioid agonists or/and antagonists) connected with designed linkers have potent analgesic properties [25-34]. Compound 35 may be useful in the treatment of opioid dependence.\nStudies of peptide-nonpeptide ligands, which are a&nbsp;combination of \"address\" segments of endogenous opioid peptides and selective alkaloid ligand (47-50) indicate that peptide part of the analogues can modulate the receptor selectivity of the attached alkaloid pharmacophores [35]. Series of peptide-nonpeptide ligands containing different classes of opioid peptides and fentanyl (52-86) were synthesized and tested for binding affinity to \u03bc and \u03b4 opioid receptors [38-40]. Good opioid affinity and antinociceptive activity of some of the obtained bivalent ligands (57, 61, 63) suggesting that a&nbsp;novel class of analgesics can be further developed utilizing this approach. Among homobivalent ligands the most important is biphalin 87 and its analogues (88-124) [41-53]. Analgesic potency of the most active ligand 112 is greater than parent peptide (biphalin) and morphine.",

            "abstract": "Interfaces have been recently a&nbsp;subject of profound interest for physicists, chemists and biologists because of the processes taking place in the interfacial region like adsorption, catalysis of chemical reactions etc. Computer simulations treat an interface in a&nbsp;full atomic level and by that they are a&nbsp;valuable complementary technique for experiment and theory. In this paper, different methods for the calculation of an interfacial tension by computer simulations are described and compared. The most commonly used method for the interfacial tension calculation was developed by Kirkwood-Buff. It is based on the mechanical route definition. This approach uses normal and tangential pressure components of the pressure tensor. The interfacial tension can be also evaluated through its thermodynamic definition. The method of Bennett defines the interfacial tension as the free energy difference of two (or more) systems relative to the difference in interfacial areas. The \"test-area\" method is based upon the perturbation formalism. The test state is obtained from an infinitesimal change of the surface area of the reference system. The third method based on the thermodynamic route used to evaluate the interfacial tension is thought as an expanded ensemble simulation where two systems with different free energy and the interfacial area are connected by a&nbsp;discrete chain of intermediate subsystems. The next approach is based on the capillary wave theory formalism which provides a&nbsp;relationship between the surface tension and the wave width due the capillarity broadening. Interfacial tension may be also computed from the square gradient theory which is based on the expansion of the Hemholtz free energy in the Taylor series around the homogeneous state with the assumption that the molecular gradients in the interface are small compared to intermolecular distance. The theoretical basis, application and results of computer simulations of each method are presented. Aa accuracy of the methods in different simulation methodologies and systems is compared.",

            "abstract": "Dactyloscopy as one of the branches of forensic science deals with fingerprints identification of the individual human being. Fingerprints are in general invisible, therefore in order to set about the identification, we have to make them evident. To reveal hidden fingerprints, criminological technology uses physical methods, chemical reactions and even some biological processes. In this review, we present a&nbsp;set of methods that is being used in criminology to reveal fingerprints and other hidden traces.\nIn search for potential fingerprints, objects are exposed to natural and artificial light sources since visual methods are most commonly used by criminology technicians. Further methods for revealing fingerprints are selected on the basis of type of surface, the trace was left on, and the substance forming the fingerprint. In his article we present the set of methods, commonly used to reveal fingerprints, featuring physical, chemical and physicochemical approaches [6].\nChemical methods: DFO, 1,2-IND and Ninhydin used for revealing fingerprints on absorptive surfaces, Amido Black, Hungarian Red, DAB and LCV used for detecting bloody fingerprints, DMAC used for revealing fingerprints on temperature-felt papers, RTX dioxide of ruthenium used to absorptive and nonabsorptive surfaces [9, 11, 14, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30].\nNext, we present physical methods among others optical methods which are helpful in revealing fingerprints for the naked eye and (if needed) enlarging optical devices. To achieve acceptable visibility, criminologists use various kinds of lamps and filters. Subsequently we present methods based on adhesion, that are based on adjoining the powder or suspension to sudoral-fatty substance. We present here methods based on the use of dactyloscopic powders, crystal violet which is appearing in the form of dark-green powder , SPR (Small Particle Reagent) - suspension of black MoS2 powder, Sticky-side Powder which composition is accessing iron oxide and aluminum, Wet Powder Black, composed of iron oxide and Wet Powder White (titanium dioxide). Tape-Glo (ready-made red-orange solution), Sudan Black B (in the solid state it is a&nbsp;powder of the black colour), Liquid-drox (yellow solution), fluorescent dyes: Ardrox P133D, Safranin O, chelate of europium and Basic Yellow 40 [31, 34-38].\nThe other methods are physicochemical methods: cyanoacrylate, iodine, physical developer and multi metal deposition [42, 45, 46].\nAs a&nbsp;result of technological development newer methods of visualizing latent fingerprints appear, replacing those previously used. Improvement of the methods of revealing latent fingerprints leads to better readability and in effect, makes police work easier.",

            "abstract": "Management of acute and chronic pain has always been a&nbsp;key area of clinical research. Pain and stress stimulation may cause an increase in the level of endogenous opioids in the body. Endogenous enkephalins activate opioid receptors in the brain, leading to the analgesic effect. Enkephalinases inactivate endogenous opioids, abolishing their activity. Enkephalin degrading enzyme inhibitors (EIs) in turn inhibit these enzymes, preventing them from degrading endogenous enkephalins what leads to analgesia. The enkephalin degrading enzyme inhibitors seem to be promising analgesic agents [2]. Analgesic effect of EIs has been discovered recently and their therapeutic potential has not been effectively investigated yet. The main advantage of enkephalinase inhibitors is that they do not show adverse effects characteristic for opioids. EIs play an important role in modulating nociception, so they are potential agents for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. They often possess also additional antidiarrheal, antidepressant and anticancer properties [3]. The potential EIs targets appear to be aminopeptidase N (APN), dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) [4].\nEIs may be broadly classified as endogenous and those that are obtained synthetically [4]. The purpose of this work is to present a&nbsp;review of endogenous enkephalinase inhibitors: sialorphin, opiorphin, and spinorphin.\nSialorphin (Gln-His-Asn-Pro-Arg) is synthesized predominantly in the submandibular gland and prostate of adult rats in response to androgen steroids and is released locally and systemically in response to stress. Sialorphin protects endogenous enkephalins released after nociceptive stimuli by inhibiting NEP in vivo. Sialorphin prevents spinal and renal NEP from breaking down substance P and Met-enkephalin in vitro. Sialorphin suppressed pain sensation for both chemical-induced inflammation and acute physical pain [8, 9, 12].\nOpiorphin (Gln-Arg-Phe-Ser-Arg) is an endogenous chemical compound first isolated from human saliva. Opiorphin is a&nbsp;natural analgesic. Opiorphin protects enkephalins from degradation by human neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N. Opiorphin is closely related to the rat sialorphin peptide [12, 13, 19].\nSpinorphin (Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr) has been isolated from the bovine spinal cord as an endogenous inhibitor of enkephalin - degrading enzymes. Spinorphin is an antagonist of the P2X3 receptor and a&nbsp;weak partial agonist/antagonist of the FP1 receptor [24, 25, 26].",

            "abstract": "Structural changes induced in crystals by photochemical reactions were presented. The changes concern: a) the distances between neighbouring reactant molecules and their mutual orientation in the case of intermolecular reactions, b) the distances and angles between fragments of a&nbsp;molecule for intramolecular reactions, c) the position of molecules in crystals, d) geometry of hydrogen bonds, e) cell constants, and f) the content of product molecules in crystals. For most intramolecular reactions, the distances between reactive atoms are constant for a&nbsp;long time in phototransformation and decrease rapidly at its end (Figs. 3 and 5). In the case of intermolecular reactions, the distances between reactive atoms of reactant molecules decrease linearly along with the phototransformation of crystals (Fig. 7). Additionally, unreacted molecules become, to a&nbsp;certain degree, similar to product molecules in terms of their shape (Figs, 4 and 8). Reactant and product molecules do not assume a&nbsp;fixed place in crystals. Product molecules change their orientation towards that of which is observed in a&nbsp;pure product crystal and reactant molecules gradually move away from the position they took in pure reactant crystals. All this has an influence on the geometry of hydrogen bonds existing in crystals (Fig. 9). The above-mentioned structural transformations find their expression in values of cell constants (Fig. 10). The factors influencing the photoreactivity of molecules in crystals were also described. Knowledge of crystal and molecular structures of partly reacted crystals, determined thanks to X-ray structure analysis which is a&nbsp;branch of crystallography, reveals the behaviour of molecules in crystals in which photochemical reactions proceed and helps to understand a&nbsp;pathway of these reactions.",

            "abstract": "X-ray structural analysis might be regarded as a&nbsp;method of visualizing molecules as they appear in the crystals. The model, which is conventionally and universally used in this method, the Independent Atom Model (IAM) assumes that the electron density distribution, which scatters the X-rays is built of the spherically-symmetrical, neutral atoms. This model is responsible for the unprecedented success of X-ray structural analysis, which reflects in about one million crystal structures (i.e. the sets coordinates of the atoms constituting the molecules) deposited in the various databanks (cf. Fig. 1), and in the speed and accuracy which the method has reached. In principle, in few hours one can get the complete information about the crystal structure.\nBut this success is accompanied by negligence of the scientific virtue hidden beyond the IAM. In fact, it was known from the very beginning of the X-ray diffraction studies by von Laue and Braggs, that some fine details of the electron density distribution should be available. The technological advance (four-circle diffractometers, powerful X-ray sources, fast computers etc.) caused that in 1960's the time was ripe for the development of the experimental studies of details of electron density distribution in the crystals, beyond the IAM. The early experiments by Coppens and co-workers proved that this information - about the electron density transferred to the covalent bonds, lone pairs, even intermolecular interactions - can actually be obtained and analyzed (Fig. 2). The need for the model which could be used in the least-squares procedure led to the formulation of so-called pseudoatom models, including the most popular till now, Hansen-Coppens model (eq. 2) in which the aspherical part is described in terms of real spherical harmonics.\nIn this paper, the basics of the electron density studies is described in some detail, including the step-by-step description of a&nbsp;typical procedure from the experiment to the final steps of refinement. An example of the analysis of the high-resolution structure of 1,2-dimethyl-4-nitro-5-morpholine-imidazole hydrate is used to show an application of this method in studying the intermolecular interactions, including weak C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O and C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bonds. It is shown that the multipolar model is able to deliver more informations than the promolecular model with spherically symmetrical electron distributions.",

            "abstract": "X-rays are diffracted by the electron density of crystals. Thus, the correct analysis of a&nbsp;single crystal X-ray diffraction pattern can provide information about the distribution of the electron density. How precise and accurate the information could be is largely determined by the resolution of the data collected. The majority of X-ray diffraction data is collected at and below the standard resolution, dmin = 0.84 \u00c5. Before the development of pseudoatom databases, such resolution permitted to carry out X-ray refinement only with the use of simple model of electron density called the Independent Atom Model (IAM). In the IAM, individual atoms are represented by the spherically averaged electron density distributions obtained by theoretical methods for isolated atoms in the ground state. The IAM does not take into account changes in the density distribution of individual atoms caused by such phenomena as chemical bond formation, charge transfer, lone electron pairs, etc. Only the geometrical information of the crystal structure is obtained from the IAM refinement.\nA more physical model has been introduced in which an atom is represented as a&nbsp;finite spherical harmonic expansion of the electron density around each atomic center and is called a&nbsp;pseudoatom. Such definition allows the pseudoatom electron density to be individually adjusted (by changing values of pseudoatom parameters) to account for density departure from spherical and neutral model. However, to refine pseudoatom parameters with experimental data subatomic resolution is required.\nIt has been shown that the values of pseudoatom parameters are almost identical for atoms in similar chemical environments, i.e. atoms having similar local topology of connecting chemical bonds. Therefore it was possible to build a&nbsp;databank of different types of pseudoatoms and to use the bank to generate the Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM) for any organic molecule, including proteins and nucleic acids. There are three different pseudoatom databanks being developed: ELMAM2, GID and UBDB. They differ by the source of pseudoatom parameters and by the way how atom types are defined. Replacement of the IAM model by the TAAM in the refinement procedure of standard diffraction data leads to more accurate geometrical information and provide access to quantitative estimation of the electron density distribution and properties derived from it (dipole moment, electrostatic potential, etc.) for molecules in a&nbsp;crystalline environment.\nThe review summarizes the research on the verification and application of pseudoatom databases.",

Thus, the methods that deal with an analysis of the electron density distribution should have a&nbsp;particular appeal for chemists and help to understand the electron structure of molecules. The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules gives the unique opportunity to have an insight into a&nbsp;region (e.g., an atom) of a&nbsp;given system (e.g. a&nbsp;molecule), delivering partitioning scheme which is defined explicitly within the rigorous quantum theory, from one side, and is applicable for experimentally available set of observables, from the other side. In that way QTAIM delivers a&nbsp;chemist a&nbsp;theoretical tool to study a&nbsp;small part of a&nbsp;molecule only, instead of dealing with the total energy of a&nbsp;whole system. In consequence, QTAIM has become one of the most powerful utilities of modern chemistry, forming a&nbsp;bridge between advanced theoretical and experimental techniques. In particular the properties of the electron density function in the so-called bond critical point (BCP, the (3, -1) saddle point on electron density curvature) seem to be valuable information for chemists, since it was proven in many papers that the chemical bonding can be characterized and classified on the basis of electron density characteristics measured in BCPs .\nIn this review we firstly give a&nbsp;brief introduction to the theory, explaining most basic terms and dependences. In the main part of the review we discuss application of QTAIM in the qualitative and quantitative analysis of several various noncovalent interactions, focusing readers attention on such aspects as classification of interactions and interaction energy assessment. Both theoretical and experimental approaches are taken into account. We also discuss extensions of QTAIM to the analysis of the so called source function - the method which additionally enlarge interpretative possibilities of its parent theory.\nFinally, we give some examples which perhaps escape a&nbsp;rigorous QTAIM definition of chemical bonding. We acquaint the potential reader with arguments being pro- and against the QTAIM-based deterministic model of a&nbsp;chemical bond.",

Since its discovery many years went by, and yet it has been performed by the trial and error method.\nSelection of the suitable resolving agent is crucial for racemic resolution efficiency. Hence, this review is concerned with common features of crystal structures of salts, in which resolving agents, frequently used for separation of racemic acids, are involved. Among them, there are crystal structures of salts of primary, secondary and tertiary chiral amines (1-arylethylamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, deoxyephedrine, chinine, chinidine, cinchonine, cinchonidine, strychnine and brucine). In most of them, cations and anions are involved in characteristic systems of hydrogen bonds leading to formation of cationic-anionic self-assemblies. In this respect, brucine and strychnine appear as unique, because presence of anions usually does not affect formation of common cationic self-assemblies stabilized by weak hydrophobic interactions.\nComparison of the common structural motifs indicates different factors being crucial in molecular recognition and in diastereomeric diversification. Formation of common hydrogen bonded cationic-anionic self-assemblies plays a&nbsp;dominant role in molecular recognition of a&nbsp;given acid by most of the studied amines. In turn, formation of common cationic self-assemblies stabilized by hydrophobic interaction plays a&nbsp;crucial role in molecular recognition of a&nbsp;given acid by brucine or strychnine.\nDiastereomeric diversification can be realized in various ways. In extreme cases, when molecular recognition in crystals of particular diastereomeric salts is similar, diastereomeric diversification is governed by different factors, depending on factors governing molecular recognition. Hydrophobic interactions play an important role in diastereomeric diversification when molecular recognition is governed by hydrogen bonds. In turn, when molecular recognition is governed by hydrophobic interactions, different hydrogen bond systems in crystals of particular salts are responsible for their diastereomeric deversification.",

            "abstract": "CNG repeats (N stands for one of the four natural nucleotides) are a&nbsp;special class of microsatellite sequences of the human genome. They are most often found in exons, in their coding parts as well as in the 5' or 3' untranslated regions. Characteristic frequencies of their occurrence within the different parts of the genes suggest that they play a&nbsp;functional role. The number of CNG repeats in a&nbsp;block is usually below 30 but it can undergo abnormal expansion leading to the development of one of approximately 20 neurological diseases known as TREDs (Triplet Repeat Expansion Disorders). One model of pathogenesis proposes that the toxic factor is mRNA containing an expanded run of CNG repeats. The anomaly results in aberrant alternative splicing and/or accumulation of the RNA in the cell nucleus, followed by a&nbsp;sequestration of important regulatory proteins and formation of RNA/protein aggregates known as nuclear foci. This is accompanied by a&nbsp;deregulation of vital cellular processes.\nIn this paper we have focused on crystallographic studies of RNA oligomers with embedded CNG repeats. We describe briefly diseases associated with each type of repeat and present the crystal structures. All the CNG repeats form stable \"hairpins\" consisting of a&nbsp;small apical loop and a&nbsp;long double-stranded stem, in which the non-canonical N-N pairs are flanked by the standard C-G and G-C pairs. All CNG repeats form duplexes of type A, characteristic of RNA, but with local deviations from the typical geometry (Fig. 1). The duplexes are stabilised by the strong C-G and G-C Watson-Crick interactions, while the N-N pairs are accommodated within the helical context, each in a&nbsp;characteristic way (Fig. 2). The U-U pairs tend to form just one hydrogen bond, instead of two observed in other contexts. The interactions within the C-C pairs are even weaker, via one very weak hydrogen bond or none. On the other hand, accommodation of the bulky A-A pairs involves pushing the purine rings towards the major groove while in the G-G pairs one of the guanosine residues flips to a&nbsp;syn conformation. The unrealised hydrogen-bonding potential of the N-N pairs is externalised into the major and the minor grooves and can be assessed through interactions with ordered water molecules and other small ligands. The N-N pairs are associated with local distortions of the A-helix (Fig. 1). All the CNG repeats show a&nbsp;characteristic striped pattern of surface electrostatic potential in the minor groove (Fig. 3). Assessment of the different CNG structures allows us to identify the characteristic and the common features (Tab. 1).",

In connection with a&nbsp;number of methodological improvements and new crystallographic software ranging from data processing to refinement, a&nbsp;unique opportunity has arisen to determine the macromolecular structures with unprecedented high resolution and quality, at a&nbsp;level traditionally reserved for small molecules.\nAt this resolution, individual atoms are clearly resolved and fine details of the structures become visible directly in the electron density maps.\nThe great importance of such structures is the possibility of having broader insights into macromolecule function. At very high resolution, hydrogen atoms can be seen in electron density maps and the detailed information about the protonation states of catalytically important residues can be studied, what often is critical for full understanding of enzymatic reactions.\nAtomic resolution gives the opportunity for clear definition of multiple conformations, although the proportion of disordered residues is higher at higher resolution, and the disorder is seen as distinct alternative conformations.\nWater in macromolecular crystal plays an important role in macromolecule's function and stabilization. Ultrahigh resolution data allows to refine water molecules with anisotropic displacement parameters and refine them with fractional occupancies. In this situation analyzing the subtle hydrogen bond network, involving precisely located water molecules, is possible.\nAtomic resolution structures can be refined without or with only very weak stereochemical restraints. Macromolecular models refined at ultrahigh resolutions, for well ordered structures, can be used for validation and improvement of stereochemical restraint libraries, commonly used during refinement of macromolecular structures.",

The outstanding scientists Meldal and Sharpless presented their concepts of Click Chemistry. Among the reactions chosen for this concept the reaction of Copper(I) Catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition (CuAAC) became the most popular one. It is the basis of syntheses employed for building blocks synthesis in medicinal chemistry and material science. Libraries of potentially pharmacologically active anticancer and antivirus compounds possessing neutral triazol linkage could be easily obtained.\nRemarkable efficiency of CuAAC reaction influenced on DNA- and RNA- based synthesis of novel oligonucleotides derivatives. Many of nucleic acid molecular modifications found applications in enzymatic transformation, nucleic acid hybridization, molecular tagging and gene silencing. The CuAAC reaction allows for introducing modifications into practically every region of nucleoside/nucleotide/oligonucleotide. This includes versatile modifications of the base moiety both aiming at the base pairing ability or specific labeling of the nucleoside unit. Different conjugates (bio-, fluorescent-, affinity- or spin labels) are being attached to the base part of the nucleic acid taking advantage of the presence of azide or alkyne substituents, which can be installed without great difficulty.\nLabeling at the sugar part of the nucleoside can be realized at the position 2', 3' or 5', the latter two giving rise to the end-labeled oligonucleotides and the 2' position serving as the attachment point for labeling inside the oligonucleotide chain. These kind of nucleic acid modifications are very promising. Versatility of CuAAC reactions is demonstrated by numerous examples of introducing modifications into practically every reactive site of the nucleotide/oligonucleotide molecule. The review systematically presents application of the \"click\" technique for modification of nitrogenous base, sugar or pseudosugar moiety or phosphorus center. Possibility of creating new kind of chain linkage, devoid of negative charge and nuclease resistant is also shown.

Structural characterization of polymers generally includes: an assessment of the average molecular weight (Mn) and the molar mass distribution (PD) to determine the structure of repeating units (mers) sequence analysis of the copolymer, identification of the end groups, the detection and identification of contaminants and substances present in the composition of the polymer asa dopant. Modern mass spectrometry (MS) offers the opportunity to study the smallest structural details of macromolecular materials [1-10].\nBecause of the variety of potential structures of polymer analysis process is to answer a&nbsp;few questions by a&nbsp;certain pattern. The first step is to determine the chemical structure of the polymer backbone. The second step is to identify whether the chains have branching points and define the degree of branching. The third important step is to correct end groups identification, also for the detection of cyclic oligomers that can be present.\nThe structural studies can be made by mass spectrometer using reflectron mode. In the essence, the method involves three steps. The first analysis is performed with standard mass spectrum of the sample. Then the precursor ion (parent ion) is selected, which is subjected to further analysis by MS changed voltages and reflectron mode.\nThis paper aims to present the issues related to the detailed analysis and characterization of polymeric materials produced on a&nbsp;large scale. Before, for materials such as poly(propylene), poly(ethylene), poly(styrene), polycarbonate, etc., increasing demands on the mechanical and technological parameters were placed. Maintaining a&nbsp;high level of products is associated with a&nbsp;very rigorous process control of the manufacturing, processing and transportation at every stage.

            "abstract": "Isoflavones are a&nbsp;subclass of flavonoids and are also described as phytoestrogen compounds, since they exhibit estrogenic activity (similar effects to estradiol hormones). The basic characteristics of isoflavone structure is a&nbsp;flavone nucleus, composed of two benzene rings (A and B) linked to a&nbsp;heterocyclic ring C (Fig. 1). The benzene ring B position is the basis for the categorization of a&nbsp;flavanoid class (position 2) and a&nbsp;isoflavonoid class (position 3) [8]. Isoflavones are classified according to substitutions. The glucoside forms can be esterified at the 6''-O-position of the glucose ring with malonyl or acetyl groups forming another compounds.\nIn food and plants, flavonoids exist primarily as 3-O-glycosides and polymers [14]. Isoflavonoids are a&nbsp;group of chemical compounds which is widely distributed in the vegetable world. Their biological activity has found remarkable pharmaceutical, therapeutic, dietary and nutritional applications. The structure of phytoestrogens enables them to bind to the estrogen receptors (ERs), they are similar to 17\u03b2-estradiol, contain an aromatic ring with hydroxyl group and have the binding affinity to both estrogen. In addition, isoflavones interact with the metabolism of steroid hormones. Recently, they have come into focus of interest due to several reports about their positive effect on human health, in particular prevention of hormone-dependent cancers, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, adverse menopausal manifestations and age-related cognitive decline.\nTo identify the potential health benefits associated with the consumption of isoflavones, it is of critical importance to have high-quality and comprehensive data. To this end, adequate analytical methodologies are essential for a&nbsp;reliable and exact identification as well as for quantification. Moreover, methodologies and techniques used need to keep up with technology to improve the performance in terms of resolution, efficiency, precision, reproducibility and speed, allowing a&nbsp;proportionate increase in the amount and quality of information gathered [7].\nCommon methods for the extraction of isoflavones from soybeans and soy products include organic solvent extraction with aqueous methanol, ethanol or acetonitrile, using simple mixing, ultra-sonification or refluxing techniques [24].\nThe application of micro-scale and nano-scale extraction and separation techniques is the most likely future development, resulting in quick, sensitive analytical methods for sample preparation and analysis of flavonoids and their metabolites. Miniaturization, high-throughput systems utilizing new sorbents and automation of chromatographic systems are of great interest in clinical, pharmaceutical, environmental and food fields. The most used analysis technique for the quantification of isoflavones in solid samples is, with no doubt, reversed-phase HPLC using C18 based columns with water and methanol or acetonitrile containing small amounts of acid as a&nbsp;mobile phase [7].\n",

It is suggested that these compounds are formed from acylglycerols, under the influence of high temperature [9]. The emphasis was put on the toxicity of the products of their deesterification-free 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) and glycidol. Glycidol is genotoxic and has an effect on gene mutations and unscheduled DNA synthesis [17]. 3-MCPD is defined by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) as a&nbsp;genotoxic carcinogen [6, 19]. There are three transformation tracks leading to increased levels of 3-MCPD in foods: from 3-MCPD esters, GE and glycidol [14, 15]. The content of 3-MCPD esters and GE in food products was characterized and different processes involving their synthesis were described. Ways of reduction in food products regarding the aspects of raw materials as well as technology were discussed. Among refined vegetable oils, the largest quantities of 3-MCPD esters and GE were found in palm, corn and coconut oils [6, 25]. Finally, the direct and indirect methods of their determination in oils were described. There are new publications reporting on successive improvements of the existing methods for determination of 3-MCPD and its mono- and di-esters, as well as GE in edible oils [42, 43].\nUnfortunately, there is still no universal determination method, which would be simple, affordable and accessible for a&nbsp;wider group, such as food producers, that would improve consumer safety.",

The substances obtained from tuber, shoots and flowers can be used in medicine, cosmetics or food industry as a&nbsp;valuable food additive. Inulin is extracted from jerusalem artichokes. It is a&nbsp;white, odorless, soluble powder with a&nbsp;slightly sweet taste and no aftertaste. It contains a&nbsp;mixture of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides which are composed of fructose units connected by \u03b2 (2-1) links (Fig. 1). Almost every molecule is terminated by a&nbsp;glucose unit. The typical total number of fructose and glucose units in inulin is 30-35. The potential of jerusalem artichoke as a&nbsp;source for inulin, a&nbsp;natural polymer that may provide dietary health benefits for obesity, diabetes, increased calcium and magnesium absorption [41-43], while promoting the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria and several other health issues and the possible use of the crop for biofuels [17], pharmacy and cosmetics and plastics manufacturers is drawing recent interest. The health benefits of inulin provide numerous opportunities to develop functional foods in various sectors such as dairy, bakery, beverage, cereals and cereal bars, supplements, confectionary, ice cream, infant formulas, fat spreads. Inulin cannot be digested by the digestive enzymes nor broken down by the gastric acids in the human digestive system. Therefore, these non-digestible carbohydrates function as insoluble fibers. However, dietary fibers influence the consistency of stomach and bowel content, the rate of discharge from the stomach and intestines and thus the rate at which nutrients and other desirable undesirable substances are absorbed. Furthermore they have an intensive effect on human bowel movements. This makes dietary fibers an essential part of our daily menu. Several methods for inulin extraction from Jerusalem artichoke tubers have been described in this paper [7, 11, 14]. For instance, ultrafiltration can reduce the purification procedure due to convenience and rapidity (fewer steps), thus showing a&nbsp;promising prospect for industrial purposes [24, 29, 31].",

            "abstract": "Proteins are macromolecules that carry out most of the biochemical functions of the cell, which strongly depend on the secondary and tertiary structure, defined by the amino acid sequence of a&nbsp;polypeptide chain. The importance of peptides and proteins in biology and medicine inspired chemists to develop strategies for their synthesis.\nThe main limitation to the preparation of long peptides is their tendency to aggregation, what makes the coupling and deprotection reaction ineffective, and purification of the compounds difficult. Inter- and intramolecular interactions, hydrophobic character, the presence of multiple hydrogen bonds significantly affect the secondary structure of peptides, making further extension of the peptide chain very difficult.\nUndesirable aggregation process may be disrupted by reduction of hydrophobic interactions. For this purpose, various methods are used, based on the implementation of specific modifications to the peptide chain, affecting its secondary structure. These methods include, for example, incorporation of pseudoproline building blocks [5] and proximity induced peptide ligation [6, 7].\nIn some cases, it is convenient to extend the amino acid side chain to form isopeptides (Fig. 1) [14-16]. Depsipeptides can be created with the natural amino acids such as cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. The basic requirement is the presence of \u03b2-hydroxyamino component.\nThe presence of a&nbsp;depsipeptide moiety in place of an amide bond significantly change the secondary structure of native peptide and prevents from aggregation, leading to higher yields of desired compounds [18]. In the solution phase peptide synthesis, this method is free from racemization [19]. Isodipeptide units can be successfully applied in SPPS for the synthesis of \"difficult sequence\"-containing peptides [19]. \r In this paper, many examples of effective use of O-acylisopeptides method in peptide synthesis are discussed.",

Catalytic potential of oxidoreductases is most commonly used in reduction reactions. Dehydrogenases and reductases catalyze the reversible desymmetrization reactions of meso and prochiral carbonyl compounds and alkenes. The oxidoreductase-catalyzed reactions require cofactors to initiate catalysis. In most cases, it is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or its phosphorylated derivative (NADPH), which acts as a&nbsp;hydride donor. The necessity of employing expensive cofactors was, for the long time, one of the main limitations to the use of dehydrogenases. This problem was solved by developing a&nbsp;regeneration system of a&nbsp;cofactor in the reaction environment. Various systems are used for the cofactor recycling. In the case of a&nbsp;carbonyl compound reduction, an irreversible oxidation of formic acid to carbon dioxide is most frequently used. In this paper, selected examples of whole-cell and isolated enzymes applications in the carbonyl compound reduction are discussed. The application of baker's yeast, microorganisms and dehydrogenases in enantioselective enzymatic desymmetrization (EED) of prochiral ketones leads to a&nbsp;broad spectrum of chiral alcohols used as intermediates in the syntheses of many pharmaceuticals and compounds presenting a&nbsp;potential biological activity.",

            "abstract": "Nucleoside analogues have great therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer and viral diseases. Once inside the cell, they are activated by a&nbsp;series of intracellular phosphorylation steps to produce 5'-triphosphate derivatives, which can be incorporated to DNA or RNA and act as terminators of growing polynucleotide chains [1c]. In many cases, nucleoside analogues are poor substrates for the cellular kinases needed for their activation [5]. It is clear that intracellular introduction of nucleoside analogues as phosphorylated metabolites (so called pronucleotides) could circumvent difficulties associated with the use of non-phosphorylated nucleoside analogues and could even activate inactive compounds or could increase the activity of the nucleoside analogues. However, polarity and a&nbsp;ready degradation by phosphatases make the use of free nucleotide analogues impractical. Therefore, much of the recent efforts have been focused on finding suitable prodrugs of nucleoside analogue monophosphates.\nAmong the current diverse prodrug approaches, nucleoside phosphoramidate derivatives appear to be an interesting class of antiviral and anticancer agents [1c]. These prodrugs, as are devoid of negative charge, should be able to cross the cell membrane either by diffusion or utilizing transport protein [1c].\nConducted cell extract studies have provided evidence of a&nbsp;bioactivation mechanism that relies on enzyme-catalyzed P-N bond hydrolysis in phosphoramidate pronucleotides [1a,b]. It was assumed that phosphoramidate derivatives should generate nucleoside monophosphates inside the cell at rates that are influenced by both the nature of the amino group and the pH of the medium. Then nucleoside monophosphates should be phosphorylated in two different steps to the corresponding 5'-O-triphosphates (NTP) which can inhibit polymerase or be incorporated into the DNA strand being synthesized in the cell.\nOver the last decade extensive studies has been carried out to establish the mechanism of action of phosphoramidates and identification of enzymes responsible for bioactivation this pronucleotides to phosphorylated nucleosides [7, 21, 24]. Investigation of metabolism pathways provided evidence that phosphoramidase activity of Hint (histidine triad nucleotide-binding proteins) play a&nbsp;key role in the activation of phosphoramidate pronucleotides [23-27].",

They are considered as a&nbsp;resource that has been used by humans to some extent [6]. Nowadays, algal biomass is a&nbsp;renewable source of many valuable bioactive substances, having a&nbsp;wide array of applications in many industries, such as food, chemical, agricultural, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, medical. The present work focuses on the impact of algae on the human body. The potential use of algae and algal extracts in medicine and cosmetic industry is discussed. Due to the antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory properties, algae can be used in the curing of many types of diseases [7, 8]. These properties result from the biologically active compounds present in the biomass of algae. The components of the algae that may help in the treatment tumor diseases are: polyphenols [37], polysaccharides [38], carrageenan [33-35], fucoidan [24, 30-32], fucoxanthin [25], diterpenes [27-29] or monoterpenes [36]. Substances extracted from algae with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic include: fucosterol [48], porphyrins [52], lactones, phenols, carbohydrates [40], polysaccharides [51, 53, 54], fucoidan [46], galactan [49], fucan [45]. Fucoxanthin [64-68], fucoidan [58], triacyloglycerols [69], polyphenols [71] or phlorotannin [63] can be used as anti-obesity agents. Overreaction of the immune system to harmless environmental substances can be minimized by the use of antiallergic substances, which include mainly phlorotannins [73, 77, 78] and fatty acids [79, 80]. The components of algae, such as polysaccharides [99-101], diterpenes [91], bromophenol [90], carbohydrates [102], fucans [96, 97], galactans [98], carrageenan [94], fucoidan [92] or galactofucan [93] could be successfully utilized against various types of viruses. It has been proved that algae show dermatological and cosmetic properties: anti-inflammatory and bactericidal action (due to the presence of zinc) [8, 9, 19, 113], increase of the flexibility of the skin (peptides and vitamins) [13, 104, 105], improve blood circulation of the skin and thanks to the alginic acid they treat erythema [13, 103]. They influence on of inhibition of sebum secretion and on other problems of oily skin. Algae are used in many cosmetics to tone up the skin, lighten stretch marks [104, 111, 112]. Compresses made of algae slenderize and eliminate cellulite. a&nbsp;field of skin cosmetics called Thalassotherapy is a&nbsp;form of therapy that uses marine climate, sea water, mud, algae, sand and other substances derived from the sea as a&nbsp;therapeutic agents [13, 103].",

            "abstract": "Ulosonic acids are key intermediated in many important biochemical pathways. One of them is DAH, which takes part in the shikimic acid pathway, as precursor in aromatic amino acids biosynthesis [1]. Another interesting compound is KDN isolated from rainbow trout egg [2], where it is responsible for the protection of the embryo in the early stages of embryonic development [3].\nIn the nature ulosonic acids are synthesized from phosphorylated sugar aldehydes and phosphoenolpyruvate in enzymatic aldol reaction. Mimic of enzymatic catalysis by asymmetric direct aldol reaction is one of the challenges of modern organic synthesis. Unfortunately, installation of the pyruvate unit in laboratory conditions is quite problematic.\nThe aim of this short review was to present synthetic equivalents of phosphoenolpyruvate, which over the years become more and more similar to the biosynthesis of ulosonic acids in living cells.\nThe first applied pyruvic acid unit was 2-acethylthiazole used as stoichiometric lithium enolate in aldol addition [9]. Next, the same research group used the phosphine derivative of 2-acethylthiazole in Wittig olefination of sugar aldehydes with subsequent stereoselective syn Michael addition of the benzyl oxide anion.\nAnother puryvate equivalent is dimethyl acetal of pyruvic aldehyde successfully used in organocatalytic [12] and metalorganocatalytic [14] direct aldol reactions.\nNowadays sterically hindered aromatic ester of pyruvic acid is probably the best puryvate unit. This ester was successfully used as aldol reaction donor in synthesis of two 3-deoxy-2-ulosonic acids - KDG and KDO [18]. Aryl pyruvate reacts with aldehydes to give aldol product with high efficiency and good diastereoselectivity in reaction catalyzed by chiral tertiary amines represented by Cinchona alkaloids. Chiral sugar aldehydes and pyruvate ester, are the building blocks that famously mimic the biological precursors of ulosonic acids.",

This ring would contribute to a&nbsp;steric shield of the NHC and ruthenium coordination center. Probably it may inforce a&nbsp;proper orientation of substituents in metallacyclobutane (all-cis), leading to Z-olefin formation. The obtained catalysts were investigated in model reactions: ring closing metathesis, cross metathesis and enyne metathesis. The experiments proved they efficiency. In many reactions the catalysts showed activity comparable or superior to that of commercially available Grubbs and Hoveyda 2nd generation complexes. Stereochemistry Z/E of the cross-metathesis products obtained using new and known complexes were similar as well. The catalysts were applied in the synthesis of a&nbsp;new type of \u03b1-tocopherol glycoconjugates. An efficient method of the synthesis Hoveyda 2nd type complexes starting from ruthenium trichloride was developed. It is possible to circumvent using special laboratory equipment and expensive reagents. Hoveyda type complexes can be achieved with very good yield in gram scale.",

            "abstract": "Biotransformation reactions of many organic compounds under the influence of enzymes take place with the high selectivity, rarely achieved by other methods. Ketoesters represent an extensive group of selectively bioreduced compounds. Chiral hydroxyesters and, subsequently, hydroxyacids are valuable intermediates in the syntheses of various biologically active compounds. Acyclic \u03b1- and \u03b2-ketoesters are transformed to the corresponding (R)- and (S)-hydroxyesters by using a&nbsp;specific dehydrogenases. The whole-cells enzymes, e.g. baker's yeast, may exhibit a&nbsp;different catalytic activity depending on the substrate structure. Baker's yeast enzymes selectively reduce the cyclic \u03b2-ketoesters providing mainly anti diastereomers due to the lack of rotation around the single \u03b1,\u03b2 carbon-carbon bond. The enzymatic reduction of the esters, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone derivatives gave the optically active anti-alcohol enantiomers. The reductive EED of prochiral \u03b1-ketoesters, as well as \u03b2-ketoesters is an interesting transformation in organic chemistry due to the importance of the resulting chiral \u03b1-hydroxy acids and their derivatives used as building blocks. Baker's yeast-catalyzed reduction of alkyl esters derived from pyruvate and benzoylformate allows the preparation of the (R)-alcohols.\nPolyketones can also be subjected to the reductive EED to give different compounds bearing the quaternary stereogenic centers which are broadly applied in asymmetric synthesis. In asymmetric synthesis, similarly to carbon-oxygen double bonds, carbon-carbon double bonds of prochiral alkanes can be reduced to obtain the optically active saturated compounds. The reduction of alkenes is catalyzed by both, the whole cells (microorganisms, plant cells) as well as isolated enzymes belonging to the oxydoreductases, so-called ene-reductases. The whole-cell catalysts are suitable, most frequently, for the preparative scale syntheses, but they are less chemoselective in comparison to the isolated reductases. In the case of polyfunctionalized alkenes, microorganisms can cause the additional side reaction reducing the desired product yield.",

This Australian biochemist of German origin was born in that city to an assimilated Jewish family. He was educated by a&nbsp;private teacher, and in 1905 he entered the famous liberal Johannes Gymnasium in Breslau (its building now houses Economics and Administration Schools). After leaving school in 1914, shortly before the war broke out, Lemberg began studies on natural sciences at the University of Breslau. He volunteered for an army, but was not accepted until 1917. Wounded in the Somme offensive in 1918, he resumed his studies to finish with a&nbsp;doctorate on the chemistry of uric acid derivatives (1921). He then became a&nbsp;private assistant to his Ph.D. supervisor, Professor Heinrich Biltz. However, a&nbsp;few years later, Biltz advised him to look for a&nbsp;job in the industry, and Lemberg moved to Meinheim to work for a&nbsp;pharmaceutical company. He often visited his native city where his parents and brother were living; in Breslau he also married Hanna Clausen in 1924. a&nbsp;grant from Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft and job offer from Karl Freudenberg of University of Heidelberg allowed Lemberg to come back to the scientific work, in which he decided to focus on biochemical studies. From these days dates his interest in bile pigments which led him to the habilitation in 1930. He then continued his work on linear tetrapyrroles during Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in Cambridge. Shortly after his return to Heidelberg, Nazis came to power in Germany and proclaimed the Beamtengesetz act which stated that all people of Jewish origin as well as members and supporters of opposition parties should be fined from the civil service. This ended his academic career of Lemberg in Germany. Rudolf moved to Cambridge with Hanna, however, since not all refugees could stay in the Great Britain, in 1935 he accepted a&nbsp;proposal from the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney to work as a&nbsp;research biochemist. The Lembergs immigrated to Australia to begin the new chapter in their life; a&nbsp;few years later Walter, Rudolph's brother, joined them with his family. The first years were particularly hard since the progress in the scientific work was hampered by the lack of modern laboratory equipment and experienced coworkers. In 1946, first of Lemberg's books, Hematin Compounds and Bile Pigments, co-authored by John Legge, was issued. In the following years, Rudolf broadened his interests to cytochrome c oxidase and heme A, one of the enzyme prosthetic groups. His investigations in the field were summarized in the second monograph written with Jack Barrett (\"The Cytochromes\", 1973). His scientific interests were not limited to chemistry: he devoted several papers and lectures to the problem of life origins and to the connections between religion and science. Rudolf Lemberg was one of the founders of Australian Academy of Sciences and Australian Biochemical Society. He died in Sydney in 1975.",

After discovery of Tat, Penetratin [1, 2] and several other peptides of natural origin, able to cross the cell membranes in an energy-independent manner, the structural determinants of their cell-penetrating potency were established, including polycationic character, amphipaticity and presence of proline-rich motifs [3, 4].\nCurrently known cell-penetrating peptides of natural or synthetic origin are composed of 5 to 40 amino acid residues and belong to one of the three families: oligocationic, amphipatic or proline-rich and penetrate the biological membranes by endocytosis or other ways of direct translocation. Most of these translocation mechanisms are not exclusive and may occur simultaneously, and their contribution may be different for each peptide depending on the conditions (e.g. CPP concentration, pH, etc.).\nMost CPPs demonstrate little or no mammalian cell toxicity what makes them promising vectors for drug delivery. Such vectors might be useful for efficient internalization of compounds otherways poorly penetrating biological membranes. Novel CPP-effector conjugates may become effective anticancer or antimicrobial agents of a&nbsp;great potential for chemotherapy [3, 5].\nIn this short review we present a&nbsp;glimpse at the current state of knowledge concerning sub-families, types and mechanisms of action of most prominent members of CPP family.",

            "abstract": "In continuation of our work, we herein describe next enzyme classes applied for oxidation reaction. Dioxygenases, oxidases, and peroxidases are successfully used in the synthesis of desymmetrization products with high yields and enantiomeric excesses.\nAromatic dioxygenases, such as toluene dioxygenase (TDO), naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO), and biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) found in the prokaryotic microorganisms are enzymes belonging to the dioxygenase class and are the most commonly used in organic synthesis.\nThe \u03b1-oxidation of various fatty acids in the presence of an \u03b1-oxidase from germinating peas is one of the few examples of oxidases application in asymmetric organic synthesis. The intermediary \u03b1-hydroxyperoxyacids can undergo two competing reactions: decarboxylation of the corresponding aldehydes or reduction to the (R)-2-hydroxy acids. In order to eliminate the competitive decarboxylation reaction tin(II) chloride is used as an in situ reducing agent.\nPeroxidases are the redox enzymes found in various sources such as animals, plants, and microorganisms. Due to the fact that, in contrast to monooxygenases, no additional cofactors are required, peroxidases are highly attractive for the preparative biotransformation. Oxidation reactions catalyzed by (halo)peroxydases are also often used in organic synthesis. N-Oxidation of amines, for instance, leads to the formation of the corresponding aliphatic N-oxides, aromatic nitro-, or nitroso-compounds. From a&nbsp;preparative synthesis standpoint, however, sulfoxidation of thioether is important since it was proven to proceed in a&nbsp;highly stereo- and enantioselective manner. Furthermore, depending on the source of haloperoxidase, chiral sulfoxides of opposite configurations can be obtained.",

The most important method for the separation of enantiomers is the crystallization. The crystallization can be carried out in the variants: direct crystallization of enantiomer mixtures (homo- and heterochiral aggregates - Scheme 2, 3) and separation of diastereoisomer mixtures (classical resolution) (Scheme 1) [1-5]. The most widely used method for the separation of enantiomers rests on the crystallization of diastereoisomers formed from a&nbsp;racemate and an enantiopure reagent - resolving agent (resolution via salt-formation and complex-formation).\nThe pair of diastereoisomers exhibit different physicochemical properties (e.g., solubility, melting point, boiling point, adsorbtion, phase distribution). For this reason, the crystalline material can be separated from the residue by filtration (Scheme 22) [4, 27], distillation (Scheme 23, 24) [28, 29], sublimation (Scheme 25) [4, 30], or extraction (Scheme 26) [2, 31].\nThe composition of crystalline diastereoisomers is influenced by resolving agent (structure (Scheme 4) [4] and amount of resolving agent (Scheme 5) [4]), structure of racemates (Scheme 10) [2, 15], the character and amount of supplementary additives (Scheme 6-9) [4, 12-15], nature of the solvent (crystallization with solvent) - Scheme 11-18 [2, 4, 16-23] and time of crystaillzation (Scheme 19-21) [4, 14, 25, 26].",

The diastereomers are then separated by crystallization taking advantage of the different solubility of the two compounds [1-3].\nThe formation of diastereomers, to be separated afterward, usually consists of salt formation with a&nbsp;resolving agent of opposite acide-base character (Scheme 1- 9). In this process, the molecules of opposite character (amine and acid) recognize each other by various interactions on the basis of their molecular structures and functional groups [3].\nUsing this method can be obtained a&nbsp;series of enantiomerically pure amines (Scheme 2-8) [4-26] and acids (Scheme 10-17) [27-41] which may be valuable substrates for asymmetric synthesis.

            "abstract": "An adhesive is any substance that, when applied to the surfaces of materials, binds the surfaces together and resists separation. The basic ingredients are adhesive firming agents (binder), solvents, adhesion enhancing agents (plasticizers, coalescing agents), wetting agents, modifiers and stabilizers. There are many criteria for the distribution of adhesives taking into account their characteristics and purpose, of which the basic division is made according to their chemical base and the method of curing [1].\nPressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) represent a&nbsp;system that actually dates back to the invention of the self-adhesive articles in 1935 when R. Stanton Avery produced the first coating unit using a&nbsp;wooden cigar box with two holes cut in the bottom. PSAs can be defined as a&nbsp;special category of adhesive which in dry form are permanently tacky at room temperature [2]. Pressure-sensitive adhesives require certain properties: besides a&nbsp;good surface adhesion, good stability against light, oxygen, moisture and plasticizers, and the adhesion characteristics is constant over a&nbsp;very wide temperature range. They are characterized by the excellent low constant level of peel strength and tack as well as the excellent aging performance at room or higher temperatures. The inherent tackiness of PSAs allow them to wet and adhere quickly under a&nbsp;low pressure on a&nbsp;broad variety of substrates [3].\nThere are many criteria for the division of PSA taking into account their characteristics and intended use, where the basic division is made according to their chemical base and a&nbsp;method for curing. In practice, the most commonly used criteria for the allocation of adhesives include: form (consistency), methods and fields of application, rate of binding, joint properties, quantities of ingredients, properties of the thermal adhesive layer or the production process [1]. Pressure-sensitive adhesives according to the manufacturing process can be divided into solvent-based, water-borne and solvent-free PSA (Fig. 2) [14-17].\nThe most commonly used high molecular compounds used in the manufacture of pressure-sensitive adhesives include natural rubber and synthetic copolymers of ethylene and acrylic acid, polisilicones, acrylics, linear polyesters, polyether, polyurethanes. The market and technology of high-performance PSAs are expanding rapidly. a&nbsp;growing market is the result of expansion in both current and new application areas. Self-adhesive polymers possess inherent properties due to their structure that make them unique [15]. The world market for pressure sensitive adhesives was valued at USD 22.70 billion in 2012 and is expected to reach USD 31.64 billion by 2018. The global pressure sensitive adhesives market volume was 1700.5 kilo tons in 2012 and is expected to reach 2208.2 kilotons by 2018 [18].",

            "abstract": "The development of on-line technologies in the last years provided us with a&nbsp;possibility for the efficient video teaching in e- or blended- chemistry learning [1-10]. In this publication we reviewed materials which are available on the YouTube or specialist educational platforms [14-38]. The analysis indicated that on-line teaching has progressed rapidly over recent years (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). This refers also to chemistry. In particular we focused on organic chemistry. The on-line aided teaching of experimental chemistry can also support the traditional courses [9] Our experience indicated that even in bench chemistry on-line teaching can significantly improve the performance of the students. The e-chem project of the educational platform, started for the chemistry students in the University of Silesia in 2005 [15], is an example of the blended chemical teaching that was partially published on the YouTube website (Tab. 2). a&nbsp;number of other chemistry materials are available on YouTube. Some chemistry courses are also available directly at the websites of the universities while the Inducate, Skillup or Coursea [39-42] are examples of the websites that provide further useful addresses for chemistry on-line teaching. a&nbsp;concept of massive open on-line courses (MOCC) [43, 44] that appeared recently inspired several projects of commercial platforms for e-learning, providing a&nbsp;potential bases for the global teaching. The Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Canvas Network are examples of the complex educational portals for MOCCs. At the same time the important universities are vigorously playing in this area in a&nbsp;way to global university. At the moment the MOCC chemistry available was reviewed (Tab. 3).\nIn summary, the development of the on-line technologies provides a&nbsp;possibility for the efficient blended learning based video-aided chemistry teaching. In our opinion this potential is currently controlled not by technical limitations but rather by psychology barrier and formal regulations in local educational law. However, these problems will certainly be solved with the increasing availability of the on-line courses that could be supported by additional real lab classes and/or certified by exams. Global university will be of course a&nbsp;strong competition for a&nbsp;traditional education. On the other hand this also means chemical on-line courses will be better and better developed on the basis on the available on-line technologies. Eventually, this competition will also improve a&nbsp;quality of the traditional chemical education.",

            "abstract": "The activity in nanotechnology has recently increased enormously. This is due to numerous possible applications of nanomaterials in catalysis, optics, electronics, and even health protection. Many applications of silver and gold nanoparticles are possible because of their plasmonic properties. As an example of the plasmonic application of Au and Ag metal nanoparticles one can mention construction of devices for light concentration at the nanometer scale. Such deep-subwavelength optical energy concentrators are used, for example, in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to increase the Raman signal by even 10 orders of magnitude, thus facilitating the optical identification of single molecules. Large increase in local field intensity also strongly enhances nonlinear scattering, which can be potentially useful for optical signal processing. In this article we review photochemical synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, especially those methods of synthesis which are driven by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excited in Ag and Au nanoparticles. The most important step of the SPR-driven synthesis of nanoparticles is photocatalytical \r reduction of metal ions which occurs preferentially at such places of the nanoparticles, at which strong surface plasmons are excited (for example corners, etches). Therefore, during the grown of the nanoparticle, its anisotropy may increase. If the SPR of the seed particles is not excited - due to either the absence of photostimulation or a&nbsp;mismatch between the excitation wavelength and the SPR of the seeds - the deposition of metal does not occur. Therefore, SPR of nanoparticles may be also responsible for wavelength controlled size effects in the synthesis: as the nanoparticles grow and their SPRs shift from the excitation wavelength, the nanoparticles absorb less light and their growth slows. This allows for synthesis of very homogeneous samples of nanoparticles, which may be applied, for example, in various plasmonic sensors.",

This review collects selected methods of synthesis of C-nucleoside analogues which were analyzed to point out the most interesting and inspiring synthetic strategies, in many cases based on contemporary achievements. These strategies first of all take advantage of the formation of the C-C bond between the anomeric \r carbon atom of the sugar or pseudosugar moieties and the carbon atom of the modified nucleobases. Less common approach relies on the de novo construction of heterocyclic rings employed as nucleobase substitutes.

They are usually defined as singlet carbenes, in which the divalent carbonic centre is connected directly to at least one nitrogen atom in the heterocycle [1]. They have played an important role in organic chemistry ever since the first evidence of their existence. The isolation of stable, free 1,3-diadamantylimidazol-2-ylidene (IAd, Fig. 1) by Arduengo et al. in 1991 was a&nbsp;milestone in the chemistry of carbenes [2]. From the beginnings as academic curiosities, N-heterocyclic carbenes today are very useful compounds in a&nbsp;variety of organic transformations (Fig. 13). NHCs are neutral \u03c3-donors, which form very strong bonds with the majority of transition metals (stronger than phosphines). These compounds are easy-to-make ligands with great potential in homogeneous catalysis (mainly ruthenium and palladium complexes) for large number of reactions, including the coupling reactions (Heck, Negishi, Stille, Suzuki or Sonogashira reactions) and olefin metathesis [3]. Moreover, they are very useful as organocatalysts used in the benzoin condensation, the Stetter reaction and ring-opening polymerization (ROP) or transesterification [4]. In this review, we aim to give an overview of the properties and applications of NHCs, which we expect will be a&nbsp;useful introduction for chemists interested in studying and applying these important compounds. The first part of this review is devoted to the main synthetic routes to NHCs, their properties and reactivity. In the second part we describe the metal complexes with NHCs as homogeneous catalysts and their applications in various types of reactions. At the end of this part of the paper the use of NHCs as organocatalysts is presented.",

Prodrugs are defined as pharmaceutical compounds inactive in their parent form and converted either chemically or enzymatically to\r the active derivative in the organism. a&nbsp;lot of prodrugs are aromatic compounds because of benzene ring reactivity. There are two main classes of prodrugs. In the carrier-linked prodrugs, the active drug is linked to a&nbsp;carrier through bioreversible covalent bond removed by enzymatic or chemical reactions.

Additionally, based on the site of prodrugs conversion into their active forms, they are classified into two groups: prodrugs metabolized intracellulary and\r prodrugs metabolized extracellulary. Chemical or enzymatic transformation of prodrugs may occur through their reduction, decarboxylation, oxidative deamination, cyclization, phosphorylation and/or hydrolysis. These reactions enable to overcome different barriers in drug delivery through changes in aqueous solubility, chemical instability and insufficient oral adsorption. It may also cause prolonged duration of drug action. Moreover, the prodrugs strategy allows achieving brain and tumor specific targeting.

Interestingly, they could be also applied for the detection of other analytes including heavy metal ions, especially in connection with electrochemical techniques.

            "abstract": "Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3; triacylglycerol acylhydrolases) are the most commonly used enzymes in biotransformations of organic compounds. In living organisms lipases catalyze hydrolysis of higher fatty acid esters of glycerol, thus fulfill an essential function in metabolism of lipids (e.g. fats and oils) and lipoproteins. This year marks 125 years since J.R. Green has identified and described the first lipase isolated from germinated castor-oil beans (Ricinus communis L.) in the form of an extract showing hydrolytic properties. Plants, as well as bacteria are able to produce lipases what was reported in 1901 by Dutch scientist ? Christiaan Eijkman. Lipases are also produced by fungi, yeasts, and various organs of higher organisms.\nA strong foundation, which had a&nbsp;huge impact on the development of global lipase-mediated biotransformations was the discovery made in 1935 and described in Biochemistry Journal and Biochemische Zeitschrift by Polish biochemist-enzymologist Ernest Alexander Sym (1893-1950) that these enzymes retain almost full catalytic activity even in nearly anhydrous organic solvents. This was exactly fifty years before Russian chemist Alexander Klibanov in 1985 described a&nbsp;lipase-catalyzed reaction carried out in organic solvents. Since that moment, lipases have became extremely popular in both academic and industrial usage, nowadays being the most important among all biocatalysts used in biochemical processes carried out on an industrial scale.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide a&nbsp;brief characterization of the two most widely used in industrial biotransformations lipases- lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL-B) and lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (BCL) - and familiarize the readers with the issues of biotechnological processes catalyzed by them.

            "abstract": "Biotransformations are processes, in which chemical reactions are catalyzed by isolated enzymes or whole cells containing them. Among the biocatalysts, lipases are the most commonly used chiral selectors that exhibit high chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivity toward wide spectrum of organic compounds of xenobiothic nature. Moreover, lipases are very stable and active in organic solvents, as well as in neat solvents or in supercritical fluids in the absence of added water. Biotransformations by using lipases can be carried out at high substrate concentrations, at ambient temperature and neutral pH, without need for addition of cofactors, application of high pressures, extremely harsh reaction conditions or complex chemical apparatus. In addition, processes based on efficient biocatalytic technologies has proven to be beneficial for the chemical industry, as the lipases are able to catalyze reactions, which are not easily conducted by classical methods or in other cases allow reactions, which can replace several chemical steps. The above mentioned features of lipase-based biotransformations often cause significant improvement in energy efficiency (savings), and lead to a&nbsp;reduction in waste generation thereby making manufacturing processes even more economically attractive and environmentally acceptable.\nSince the mid-1980s the use of biotransformations with lipases in industry for the production of high added-value compounds, including pharmaceuticals, vitamins, cosmetics, fragrances and flavors, diagnostic preparations and therapeutics, high-tonnage preparation of agrochemicals, modified foods, nutraceuticals, detergents, polymers, advanced materials and biofuels has steadily increased.\nIn this part of the review article on industrial applications of lipases, next group of popularly utilized enzymes relevant for the production of high added-value chemicals are described. It was also shown on several examples that enzymatic catalysis can significantly simplify manufacturing processes of complex structures being green and economical alternative for conventional chemical-based processes.",

With the birth of philosophy comes first speculation about the physical conditions of life processes, which consequently will lead to the formation of the first scientific theories. Among them an important role plays the Hippocratic humoral theory. This scientific rout will be taken by the next generations of researchers seeking for the most appropriate methods and precise language of science. a&nbsp;significant breakthrough came in the 16th century, when Paracelsus coined his philosophical and alchemical doctrine which gives such attention to perpetual changes in living organisms, then described on the basis of transmutation. Nearly three centuries later, in the early nineteenth century the polish physician and chemist J\u0119drzej \u015aniadecki introduced the concept of metabolism, based on the principles that are present in compounds and chemical reactions. Just a&nbsp;dozen years later, in 1828, W\u00f6hler`s synthesis of urea gives birth to organic chemistry. Language of chemistry has become a&nbsp;tool for the description of biological phenomena, slowly building up physiological chemistry which shortly was turned to biochemistry. For a&nbsp;young science one of the first challenges was the level of the rudimental for the living organisms dyes, which rightly appeared as essential for the understanding of the chemical nature of the phenomena of life. From that point the studies on chlorophyll (Pelletier, Caventou, Shunck, Hoppe-Seyler) and hemoglobin (H\u00fcnefeld, Funke, Hoppe-Seyler) become crucial topic. In this pioneering studies significant, and sometimes decisive role was to be played by Polish scientists (Teichmann, Marchlewski, Nencki, Zaleski). Especially a&nbsp;few years' time and very intense cooperation of Leon Marchlewski and Marcel Nencki would bring momentous decision. Marchlewski's bold hypothesis about the chemical unity on the level of the basic dyes in plant and animal worlds was fully confirmed in the experimental procedure and the results achieved by Nencki brought the solution to the problem of the chemical structure of hemin. Joint research of Polish scientists became the foundation of modern biochemistry and had changed the biological and medical sciences so deeply, that we can talk about \"biochemical revolution\".

The structure of peptidoglycan depends on the bacteria strain. It is estimated that in Gram-negative bacteria, it occupies only about 10-20% of the total area of the cell wall, when in Gram-positive bacteria it is 50 and up to 90% of all space.\nProblems with isolation with high purity of biological material shows the need for developing techniques for chemical synthesis of peptidoglycan fragments and their analogs. In past few years there has been a&nbsp;growing interest within the synthesis of compounds glycoprotein (glycopeptides, peptidoglycan, etc.). As a&nbsp;basis for the construction of cell walls of many bacteria.\nDespite intensive research and gain significant knowledge of the physical and biological, chemical synthesis or biosynthesis (Fig. 5 and 6) of peptidoglycan, not so far failed to unambiguously determine its three-dimensional structure. The works of Kelman and Rogers [15] and Dimitriev [20] nearer picture of its structure. However, the time to develop in vivo visualization of cell structure it will be difficult to identify correctly peptidoglycan three-dimensional structure.\nDue to the important biological roles of murein, many research centers have taken to attempt their chemical synthesis.

            "abstract": "A subject of this work is group of organic compounds known as molecular switches. Molecular switches are described as chemical compounds which molecules have at least two thermodynamically stable states. Conversion between these states is reversible and may be induced by such factors as change of the temperature or flow of the electric current or irradiation of the molecule with the light of particular wavelength [1]. Especially interesting are photochromic molecular switches. In this group the conversion is triggered by irradiation with a&nbsp;light of a&nbsp;particular wavelength [2]. Because of its unique properties, this type of compounds is extensively studied by the scientists, who investigate their photochromic properties as ways of using them in coordination with lanthanide metals and construction of novel molecular materials [3]. Especially interesting group of photochromic molecular switches is class named diarylethenes. This type of compounds after irradiation with UV light undergo cyclization, which is reversible under light of the visible spectrum (Figure 1). The other important group of photochromic molecular switches is class of compounds possessing in their structure chiroptic unit. The irradiation of the molecule with left- and right-handed circularly polarized light leads to change of the absolute configuration (Fig. 8) [1]. This type of switches may be used in construction of synthetic molecular motors which is widely studied subject nowadays [1]. The other groups of molecular switches are host- guest molecular switches and mechanically- interlocked molecular switches. In the first mentioned before group the bistable states differ in their affinity for guests (Fig. 15) [14]. The second one is based on the group of compounds named catenanes and rotaxanes. They can be described as two chemical individuals, mechanically interlocked in each other, which are not connected with chemical bonds (Fig. 19). This kind of molecular switches are used in construction of the logic gates [1].",

Due to high prevalence of this drug detailed data concerning its pharmacokinetics and prahmacodynamics can be found as well as metabolic paths that have been proven or have not been confirmed yet. For the purpose of toxicological analyses of samples collected postmortem it is also essential to know the possible transformations of an analyte due to microbial metabolism and postmortem changes of the sample matrix. In forensic cases of unavailable or unusable blood samples when advanced stage of decomposition processes in the found body occurs, alternative matrices are required.

            "abstract": "Ion-selective electrodes are a&nbsp;routine tool of chemical analysis, characterized by beneficial analytical parameters, simple operation principle and low apparatus cost. In this group of sensors particularly advantageous are those with plastified poly(vinyl chloride) based membranes, containing ionophore - interacting selectively with some cations [1]. From the practical point of view all-solid-state constructions became very useful. However, in this case, a&nbsp;solid contact should be added between the substrate electrode and the membrane, enabling reversible charge transfer on the electrode /solid contact and solid contact/ membrane interfaces. On the other hand, an advantageous alternative for membrane material, instead of poly(vinyl chloride), are polyacrylates which can be easily obtained by photopolymerization and provide lower detection limits due to lower ion mobility in the membrane.\nMembranes of similar composition (containing ionophore) can be also applied in ion-selective optodes, where a&nbsp;solid contact is not needed, but additional membrane component is a&nbsp;dye (chromoionophore) of different colours of the protonated and deprotonated forms. Such optodes can be also obtained as microspheres, thus they can be introduced into a&nbsp;medium of low volume, e.g. living cells.\nThe next step towards sensitivity increase and miniaturization is recording fluorescence intensity instead of absorbance, by using appropriate fluorophores, e.g. pyrene, and production of nanosensors, e.g. as micelles obtained from cross-linked alternative polymers. Appropriate modification of the surface phase of such nanosensors, affecting the permeability of analyte ions into the nanospheres, enables tailoring of the shape of analytical characteristics - from sigmoidal (high sensitivity, narrow linear response range) to linear dependence of the signal on logarithm of analyte concentration (low sensitivity, but wide linear response range).",

The method requires almost no sample preparation and permits direct analysis of solid samples, availing only minute amount of the material. The micro-destructiveness of ablation processes remains usually within the scale acceptable for art historians, conservators, archaeologists and art curators, therefore the capability to perform multi-elemental, ultra trace and isotopic analysis can be fully used during studies of cultural heritage objects. The lack of appropriate matrix-matched certified reference materials and the fractionation effects, which may influence the final quantitative results to a&nbsp;different extent, are widely reported among the main limitations of LA-ICP-MS. Despite these constrains, LA-ICP-MS is a&nbsp;method that can be flexibly tuned to collect the desired elemental information about various cultural heritage objects.\nThis paper focuses on advantages of using LA-ICP-MS in analysis of heterogeneous objects in respect of mapping of elemental distribution either during the one-point or multi-line ablation executed directly from the surface of the investigated objects. The use of LA-ICP-MS allowed collection of chemical information availing reconstruction of distribution patterns, which reflected important structural characteristic of the small gilded decoration produced in mediaeval times (collection of Gallery of Medieval Art, the National Museum in Warsaw) and archaeological \"metal-in-glass\"/\"sandwich\" bead (Nubian collection, the Museum of Archaeology University of Stavanger, Norway). The mediaeval decoration was identified as the gilded (Ag+Au) copper object, which due to corrosion and re-painting has lost their original appearance. The bead was produced from two various types of glass and a&nbsp;metal foil (Ag+Au+Cu) between them. In both cases LA-ICP-MS was used successfully to determine the main elemental composition and to collect information about elemental distribution in the investigated artifact.",

Detailed description of our research can be found on webpage http://www.chem.uw.edu.pl/labs/pcas. In this paper we would like to present only a&nbsp;few topics and analytical challenges that we were dealing with during the last years. The application of anodic and cathodic stripping voltammetry for trace analysis of hazardous metals (cadmium, lead, thallium, platinum, rhodium) in natural samples is described [4-6]. Voltammetry is also presented as a&nbsp;tool used in speciation analysis, which is particularly important in the case of elements which toxicity and assimilation depends on chemical form of the element that is present in the environment (e.g. As) [8]. Attention is also paid to fractionation, which is a&nbsp;specific case of speciation analysis, extremely important for evaluation of mobility and bioavailability of harmful or nutritious substances from soil. As environmental monitoring often requires carrying measurements at trace levels, it might be necessary to preconcentrate the analytes or simplify the composition of the sample before the analysis. For such purposes solid phase extraction (SPE) is widely used and frequently applied. Another analytical task presented in this work is recognition of the defense mechanisms developed by hyperaccumulating plants, e.g. white mustard. This species was investigated for synthesis of phytochelatins - sulphur-rich polipeptides induced by high concentrations of As, Tl, Cd, Pt, Pd and Rh [14]. It is worth noting that plant species that are able to cumulate high amounts of xenobiotics can be used for phytoremediation, which is one of so called \"green technologies\", used for restitution of polluted environment, particularly soil [19].",

The main issue in the construction of such electrodes is how to immobilize a&nbsp;redox enzyme on the conductive support in a&nbsp;way allowing to retain its full activity and to provide efficient transfer of charge between the electrode and the active centres of the enzymes. The difficulty in achieving suitable electrical contact can be solved by applying suitable carbon nanomaterials, increasing the working surface of the electrode and providing access to the active centres of the enzyme molecules.",

            "abstract": "There has been growing interest in development of new methods for the determination of arsenic due to its high toxity and increasing population in the environment. At present, chromatographic (separation) and spectroscopic (detection) approaches are the most common. Although, they are characterized by high sensitivity and low detection limits, the experimental procedures often require generation of toxic AsH3. Electrochemical methods for the determination of arsenic can be considered as complimentary because they are fairly simple and they are subject to different selectivity criteria. In this respect, various stripping voltammetric procedures are becoming popular. The actual stripping voltammetric measurement consists of two steps in which preconcentration of an analyte at the electrode surface is followed by the so called \"stripping\" step involving electrode reaction recorded in a&nbsp;form of the voltammetric peak. a&nbsp;representative approach involves reduction of the analyte anions upon application of the sufficiently negative potential to form As(0) on the electrode (e.g. gold) surface; this step is followed by voltammetric oxidation (anodic stripping) of the deposit (to As(III)). In a&nbsp;case of so called cathodic stripping voltammetry, the stationary Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode (HMDE) is often used. During the preconcentration step, an insoluble salt is produced on the electrode surface. To facilitate its formation, copper or selenium species are used as mediators. Under such conditions, insoluble Cu3As2 is generated together with copper amalgam on the surface of HMDE.\nBecause sensitivity and detection limit in electroanalytical determinations strongly depend on the current densities measured, there is a&nbsp;need to search for specific catalytic materials that would induce otherwise highly slow and irreversible redox processes of As(III) (oxidation) and, in particular, As(V) (reduction). Designing effective electrocatalytic materials would be of importance to the development of more sensitive stripping methods and monitoring of arsenic under chromatographic and flow conditions. Representative examples of catalytic systems are provided and discussed here. Some attention is also paid to application of enzymes to sensing of arsenic. Electrochemical determination of arsenic(III) is generally better described in literature. Direct determination of As(V) typically requires its binding into chemical compounds. It is reasonable to expect intense research in future aiming at the developing of new electroanalytical methods for direct selective determination of As(V).",

This change in the surface properties of bacterial cells has a&nbsp;major impact on the effects of cell-cell or cell-surface during the formation of aggregates or biofilm. Each microorganism has a&nbsp;complex and characteristic cell wall composition, which surface charge originates from the ionization of carboxyl, phosphate or amino groups and the adsorption of ions from solution. Consequently, the charged cell wall groups determine the spontaneous formation of the electrical double layer (EDL). The properties of the EDL affect the behavior of biocolloid including cell-to-cell and cell-to-capillary surface interactions. In addition, the inner wall surface of capillary groups (modified and/or unmodified) interact with the solvent and the analyte. Biocolloids effect of aggregation and adhesion to the surface of the capillary is unfavorable phenomenon occurring during the electrophoretic separation. These phenomena are highly correlated with the acid-base properties of the bacterial cells. Interactions between molecules are unstable, hence the analytes adsorbed on the surface concerned can be removed using a&nbsp;variety of solvents or physico-chemical and mechanical factors. However, when the bacterial cells are in close proximity to the charged surface of the capillary may be subject to specific and non-specific short-range interactions, which are characterized by high stability.\nIt has been shown the characteristics of the microbial surface in order to determine their role in adhesion and aggregation phenomena during the electrophoretic separation.\nThe use of experimental techniques, including instrumental, electrochemical and electrophoretic allowed the description of the relationship between the acid-base properties of pathogens and their behavior.\nThe review summarizes the research on biocolloids which are helpful in understanding the interactions that occur during electrophoretic analysis.",

            "abstract": "The rapid growth in the commercial application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) will certainly increase the exposure to these metals among humans and in the environment. Nano-size silver particles have a&nbsp;broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and therefore are incorporated into various materials, including medical textiles, which claim to prevent infection, as well as more common textiles, like anti-odour sportswear, underwear, socks and gloves. On the market there is also a&nbsp;variety of home consumer products claiming to contain nanosilver, for example disinfecting sprays (to disinfect hard surfaces, towels, sheets, and clothing), kitchen cutting boards, washing machines, refrigerators, dishwashers, pillows and mattresses, toothbrushes, toilet seats, water filters, and cosmetics. Nanosilver is added to food contact materials to preserve the packaged food for a&nbsp;particularly long period of time by inhibiting the growth of microbes. There is a&nbsp;number of in vitro studies showing cytotoxic effects and genotoxic DNA damaging capacity of AgNPs to a&nbsp;variety of mammalian cell types [24]. However, there are only a&nbsp;few in vivo studies on their genotoxicity. Likely routes of human exposure to released nanoparticles include inhalation, ingestion and dermal penetration. Evaluation of the health impact of AgNPs requires information on how readily and in what forms this substance can be released from the material. At present, the availability of such data is limited (Tab. 1).\nSize of metal-based nanoparticles is an important factor determining their physical and chemical properties as well as their bioavailability and toxicity. The methods used for the size characterisation of AgNPs in different matrices (consumer products, biological and environmental samples) (Tab. 2), as well as for speciation analysis of various forms of silver, namely AgNPs and silver ions, are reviewed in this paper.\nOff-line methods such as centrifugal ultrafiltration, (ultra)centrifugation, dialysis, and cloud point extraction are used in order to distinguish between nanoparticles and dissolved forms of silver. Field-flow fractionation (FFF) in different modes is used for nanoparticle size dependent separation [50]. Size-resolved AgNPs fractions are further characterised by on-line detectors, such as UV-Vis, ICP OES or ICP MS. ICP MS in single-particle detection mode is used for simultaneous determination of nanosilver and silver ions [38]. The application of capillary electrophoresis [40] and liquid chromatography [41, 42] for the separation of nano and ionic forms of silver is also discussed in this work.",

Enrichment of target compounds, transfer of the analytes into a&nbsp;solvent compatible with the analytical instrumentation, minimization of potential interferences, and efficient sample clean-up, are among the main aims of sample preparation techniques. In this regard, liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction have been conventionally employed prior to the determination of relevant compounds in a&nbsp;variety of samples. In spite of their suitable performance, these classical techniques do not fulfill several of the challenges in analytical chemistry, including miniaturization, portability, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the necessity to determine relevant compounds at very low concentrations in matrices of different complexity, especially when dealing with reduced sample volumes, made the improvement of sample preparation techniques being of paramount importance. The inception of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) involved a&nbsp;huge advance in this sense. SPME was firstly introduced by prof. Janusz Pawliszyn in 1990 as an alternative to conventional sample preparation methods. its small size makes SPME being highly convenient for on-site analysis and monitoring, as well as in vivo analysis. a&nbsp;variety of coating fibers for extracting analytes of different polarity and volatility are nowadays commercially available. Nevertheless, the development of novel SPME fibers with improved mechanical, chemical and thermal stability is a&nbsp;current trend in analytical chemistry, as discussed in the text. In this work the information about novel methodological and instrumental solutions in relation to different variants solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is presented. The proposed solutions fulfill the requirements resulting from the concept of sustainable development, and specifically from the implementation of green chemistry principles in analytical laboratories. Therefore particular attention was paid to the description of possible uses of novel, selective stationary phases for SPME technique.

This has been mainly motivated by the seminal work, where it has been demonstrated that low energy electrons can induce single and double strand breaks in DNA in the energy range below the level of ionization. Since the damage profile as a&nbsp;function of electron energy showed pronounced resonances it was proposed that resonant electron capture could occur at particular molecular components of the DNA as the initial step towards strand breaks. From a&nbsp;series of experiments on electron attachment to DNA building blocks (nucleobases, the sugar moiety and the phosphate unit) became obvious that they effectively capture electrons leading to the formation of low energy resonances associated with the decomposition of the corresponding molecule. Recent dissociative electron attachment experiments on an entire gas phase nucleotide 2'-deoxycytidine-5\u00b4-monophosphate give also insight into the molecular mechanism involved, which comprises both direct electron attachment to the backbone and transfer of the excess electron from cytosine to the backbone resulting in single strand breaks. The results further allow an estimate of the relative contribution of these different mechanisms to single strand breaks.",

Microfluidic systems are integrated microlaboratories consisting of many microstructures such as microchannels and microchambers, which can be used for cell analysis and cell culture. Appropriately designed geometry of the chip allows to mimic in vivo conditions. Microsystems enables continuous culture medium perfusion. During cell culture, regulation of the flow rate of medium is possible, which allows to control conditions of the cultivation.\nIn this paper we present a&nbsp;review of microfluidics systems which are used in cell engineering. We describe methods of microsystems fabrication, parameters which influence cell proliferation in microscale and examples of microsystems for cell analysis and cell culturing. Microfluidic systems for maintaining cell culture are mainly fabricated of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and glass, non-toxic materials for cells. The most commonly used method for fabrication of PDMS microsystems is photolithography and replica molding techniques. Cell culture in microsystems can be carried out in two ways: as a&nbsp;two-dimensional (2D) cell culture and three-dimensional (3D) cell culture. In two-dimensional culture cells grow as a&nbsp;monolayer on a&nbsp;flat surface of microchambers or microchannels. Microsystems for two-dimensional cell culture are widely described in the literature. They are mainly used for: (i) cell proliferation after exposure to external stimuli, (ii) testing the activity of cytotoxic drugs, (iii) interactions and cell migration and (iv) the evaluation of procedures applicable in tumor therapy e. g. photodynamic therapy. However, two-dimensional cell culture do not mimic fully in vivo conditions. In living organisms cells grow spatially creating three-dimensional structures like tissues. Therefore, nowadays microsystems for 3D cell culture are being developed intensively. Three-dimensional cell culture in microfluidic systems can be achieved in three ways: by the design of suitable geometry and topography of microchannels, by the use of hydrogels or by spheroids formation. Three-dimensional cell culture in microfluidic systems are much better experimental in vitro models than cell culture in traditional culture vessels. It is the main reason why microsystems should be still improved, as to become widely used research tools in cellular engineering.",

In this work, potentiometric sensor arrays were applied to develop an electronic tongue system enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of bitter taste masking of pharmaceuticals.

The interest was drawn to clarify and describe the role of \u00df-amyloid and NSFRY copper(II) complexes, relevant to Alzheimer's disease occurrence and cardiovascular system disorder respectively. Finally, boronic acids and their derivatives, exhibiting the affinity for molecules possessing 1,2 or 1,3-diol group in their structure, were used as selective molecular receptors in the third research project.

Ideal antisense agent (ASO) should be resistant to exo and/or endonucleases, exhibit a&nbsp;suitable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile and exhibits high binding affinity towards the target mRNA. To improve some properties of the ASO plethora of the chemical modifications introduced within the nucleobase, sugar unit and internucleotide linkage are investigated [3]. Among them, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-oligo), created by replacing one of the nonbridging oxygen atoms with a&nbsp;sulfur atom, are the major representatives of DNA analogs. PS-oligo display several attractive features like nuclease resistance, activation of RNase H, and good pharmacokinetic properties [1].\nReplacement of one of two nonbridging oxygens at phosphorus by sulfur induces asymmetry at the phosphorus atom. Hence, the synthesized oligo(nucleoside phosphorothioate) is a&nbsp;mixture of 2<sup>n</sup> diastereomers (where n is the number of internucleotide phosphorothioate functions). Therefore the actual biological activity of the P-chiral oligonucleotide analogues, (e.g., interactions with proteins or nucleic acids) may depend on stereochemical factors [7]. One has to keep in mind that the phosphoramidite [5] and H-phosphonate [32] methodologies (commonly used to prepare PS-oligo) are nonstereospecific and give a&nbsp;mixture of 2<sup>n</sup> diastereomers. Thus, various methods have been elaborated to synthesize these P-chiral oligonucleotide analogs in a&nbsp;stereocontrolled manner [15, 17], among them the oxathiaphospholane method developed by Stec et al. [18], the method utilizing nucleoside 3'-O-(3-N-acyl)oxazaphospholidine derivatives as monomer units [19], and the method based on a&nbsp;stereoselective synthesis of nucleoside 3'-O-oxazaphospholidine monomers [21, 22] are the most significant.",

            "abstract": "Both plants and animals in the process of evolution gained the ability to produce compounds that affect their existence in the wild. These compounds may affect the organisms producing them, and may also be used by completely different individuals. Among huge number of molecules characterized by extremely essential features are, among others, ionones and their derivatives. Ionones are ketones composed of 13 carbon atoms. They are found in many essential oils being the products of degradation of carotenoids. Both they and their structural analogues can play various biological functions such as being deterrent to other individuals or, conversely, atractant. Compounds found in plants, containing like ionone carbon skeleton, and having in their structure additional hydroxyl groups or epoxide ring (4)-(23) often exhibit allelopathic activity [1-15] (Fig. 2-5). Marine animals may in turn use them as ichtyotoxic compounds (27) and (28) [19] (Fig. 7). a&nbsp;compound called luciferin Latia (29) is responsible for the bioluminescent properties of marine snail [20] (Fig. 8). Plants used for centuries in traditional folk medicine of different countries are a&nbsp;source of glycoside derived \u03b1- and \u03b2-ionone (37)-(55) [22-31] (Fig. 11-14). These compounds may also be used in modern medicine, inter alia, in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases or for the treatment of osteoporosis. Because of the potential biological properties of structural analogs of ionones they are also obtained by chemical synthesis (56)-(69) [32-39] (Fig. 15-18) or biotransformation (70)-(89) [40-47] (Fig. 19-25), and then subjected to careful examination of their biological activities. By applying these methods we can also obtain a&nbsp;molecules whose acquisition from natural sources is unprofitable. We have received such derivatives which have no counterpart in nature.",

            "abstract": "Tropane alkaloids are a&nbsp;long-known class of compounds possessing an 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Many tropane alkaloids posses biological activity (anticholinergic, anti-Parkinsonian, hypotensive), and as such had a&nbsp;significant influence on medicine and played a&nbsp;notable role in the development of organic chemistry [1]. The most known representatives of biologically active tropane alkaloids are: cocaine, atropine, scopolamine, ecgonine, and Bao Gong Teng A. a&nbsp;number of natural tropane alkaloids are chiral compounds, whose preparation in optically active forms is still a&nbsp;big challeng [2]. The biological activity of enantiomers often differs depending on their configurations.\nAlkaloids are a&nbsp;subject of an intensive research: scopus database contains nearly 200 thousand publications with the word \"alkaloid\", and almost 4,500 publications with the phrase \"tropane alkaloids\" (about half of them have appeared in the last ten years). About 55 papers are devoted to stereoselective synthesis of tropane derivatives in 2000-2015. About half of this concernes stereoselective methods.\nThe organic synthesis of alkaloids has a&nbsp;long history and numerous synthetic approaches to the tropane skeleton have been developed, from the classical synthesis of tropinone by Willst\u00e4tter at the beginning of the XX century, to more recent developments dealing with asymmetric deprotonation of tropinone with chiral lithium amide bases for the enantioselective synthesis of a&nbsp;range of tropanes [3, 4]. Owing to extensiveness of the field, the current review presents the most interesting, from a&nbsp;synthetic point of view, approaches to tropane derivatives and tropane analogues.\nMost of the methods of synthesis are long (often several steps), time- and recourses-intensive, and often required elaborate and hardly available starting materials. But there are also notable exceptions, based on the asymmetric deprotonation approach; e.g., from the syntheses of cocaine described in this article, the most efficient one was reported by Lee in 2000 [5]. The concise synthesis (6 steps) gave the unnatural enantiomer of cocaine starting from commercially available tropinone in 78% overall yield. This approach allows to obtain both enantiomers and racemate, by changing type of one reactant only. However, most strategies provide only one enantiomer or racemic mixture of an alkaloid. As can be seen, despite of advances in chemicall science, there is no general way to synthesize majority of the representatives of this group of structurally related compounds.",

Cardiac glycosides (CG), originally isolated from Digitalis plants, also known as cardiotonic steroids, have particularly extensive record of ethnopharmacological and medicinal use. Although their application in treatment of dropsy is documented since 1875, long time has elapsed before their chemical structure were determined and mechanisms of their toxicity and cardiotonic action were recognized as inhibition of Na+ / K+ ATP-ase pump. Contemporary molecular pharmacology has revealed that cardiac glycosides are endogenous compounds in variety of animals, where they function as toxins or hormones. Besides, numerous recent studies confirmed anticancer activity of CGs at very low concentrations. These findings have been possible due to advances in ultrasensitive analytical techniques and also due to progress in organic synthesis, particularly total enantioselective syntheses of carbohydrates, which secured availability of individual CG and their analogs for medicinal chemistry studies.",

While most of the food and feed consumed in Poland came from internal market, the implementation of this strategy in Poland may have beneficial effects on health of farm animals and local inhabitants. The most suitable plants for agronomic biofortification with selenium in Poland are crops, especially cereals and selected members of mustard plants.

The above examples describe a&nbsp;growing range of potential commercial applications of silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives. Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives typically consist of large segments of the silane-functional silicone polymers and silicone resins (MQ). It is well known that silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives because of their unique properties are special-purpose products. The combination of the properties of silicones such as high flexibility of connections Si-O-Si, low intermolecular interaction, low surface tension, excellent thermal stability and transparency for UV radiation, excellent electrical properties, high chemical resistance and weather resistance makes silicone adhesives have improved properties compared to other typical polymeric organic adhesives. Due to the low surface tension of silicone adhesives, adhesive is easily spread on the surface of various materials [4–9].</p><p>The properties of silicone pressure sensitive adhesives (Si-PSA) crosslinking thermally by organic peroxides (according to a&nbsp;radical mechanism) depend on the type and concentration of crosslinker used.

Putrescine was discovered in the end of the 19th century in microbes and then triamine: spermidine was discovered in the beginning of the 20th century [2]. Later studies have shown that in animal cells spermidine and spermine occur at elevated levels, while in prokaryotes spermidine and putrescine contents are dominant. Putrescine, spermidine, 1,3-diaminopropan, homospermidine, norspermidine, and norspermine have been found in many gramnegative bacteria and algae [7, 10, 11]. </p><p>Total concentration of PA in living organisms is on the order of millimols, however, the concentration of free polyamines is much lower. a&nbsp;low level of free amines follows from the fact that they are involved in noncovalent interactions with biomolecules occurring in living organisms such as nucleic acids, proteins, or phospholipids. High concentrations of non-bonded polyamines have been detected first of all in young molecules in the process of growth, in particular in rapidly proliferating cancer cells [6, 12]. Elevated levels of free polyamines have been observed, e.g. in breast, colon, lung, prostate, and skin tumours, accompanied by changed levels of enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines.</p><p>Because of the increased level of free polyamines and a&nbsp;tendency of their interaction with nucleic acids and other bioligands, these compounds have become objects of intense study [1, 13–19]. There is no doubt that the regulation of biosynthesis of polyamines and catabolism is one of the most important pathways in the search strategy for chemoprevention and chemotherapeutic drugs [14, 15, 20–36].

            "abstract": "Clinical chemistry is the science on the border of the two disciplines: medicine and chemistry. It is defined as the application of the chemistry in the study of biological samples in order to diagnose, treat, cure diseases as well as in monitoring and prognosis [1]. Development of clinical chemistry is dated on the 19th century. Biuret test, and a&nbsp;method for detection of sugar in the urine were then described, also blood gases were extracted [13, 17]. In the mid of 19th century blood could be analyzed for the presence of potassium, sodium, phosphorus and calcium [31]. In the second half of 19th century Duboscq built first colorimeter. This model was widely adapted in laboratories and was in use till the 20-ties of 20th century [44]. Colorimetry also became the most popular technique in the clinical chemistry. In the 80ties of 19th century was developed a&nbsp;method for estimating the concentration of creatinine and detection of bilirubin [36, 39]. Increasing number of available laboratory tests resulted in the separation laboratory diagnostic as a&nbsp;distinguish branch of science. At the beginning of 20th century has been introduced quantitative analytical methods for determination of ammonia, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, uric acid, nitrogen, phosphorus, and chloride in biological fluids as well as measurements of blood gases. In 1930 was introduced clinical enzymology with the first method for assessing the activity of alkaline phosphatase. In the mid of 20th century in the medical laboratories routinely were measured amylase, lipase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, phosphocreatine kinase, alanine and asparagine aminotransferases [78, 79]. Development of electrical engineering and computing resulted with intensive development of laboratory instruments. First automated spectrophotometer was invented in 1957 (Autoanalyzer, Technicon company). In 1970, Automatic Clinical Analyzer f. Du Pont was able to perform determinations in any configurations not as so far in the series [99].",

Hydrogen is being considered as an ideal energy source for replacing fossil fuels.</p><p>Since the breakthrough work in Science on graphene published in 2004 [22], this material has been intensively studied because of its great potential for applications in many fields of modern technology such as electronics [94–96], energy storage [21, 110, 111] and gas detection [13, 16]. As a&nbsp;two–dimensional, crystalline carbon material, graphene is characterized by superior chemicals and physical properties [2, 5]. The large theoretical specific surface area of graphene (2630 m<sup>2</sup>/g [89]) makes it an excellent material for adsorption applications. Furthermore, graphene–based materials could be doped by heteroatoms (e.g. B [72], N [106]) or decorated with various nanoparticles (e.g. Fe [55], Pd [106], Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> [8], V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> [79], TiO<sub>2</sub> [79]), which significantly improves their adsorption properties. Specific mechanism CO<sub>2</sub> [8] and H<sub>2</sub> [104–106] takes place during adsorption processes on some graphene materials containing metal or metal oxide nanoparticles on their surfaces. </p><p>In this review, the major methods for synthesis of graphene and graphene–based materials are discussed with particular emphasis on “chemical exfoliation”. The possibility of obtaining a&nbsp;high quality graphene material from waste materials such as polystyrene or biological materials such as crustacean skin [37, 41] is also reviewed. An overview of the newest synthesis methods of graphene [46] and modified graphene materials including polymer nanocomposites [61, 62] is presented too. a&nbsp;particular attention is given to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> adsorption properties of graphene–based materials [8, 62, 106]. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Pd decorated graphene materials [8, 106–108] are ones of the most effective adsorbents described so far. These materials show a&nbsp;maximum CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption capacity of 60 mmol/g at 25°C and 11 bar [8] and a&nbsp;maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of 4,4 wt% at 25°C and 40 bar [106]. </p><p>It seems, that modified graphene materials can compete successfully with the currently used adsorbents, including nanoporous carbonaceous materials such as activated carbons, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes [8, 21] or ordered mesoporous carbon materials.</p>",

Particular attention is focused on mesoporous silica (mesoporous silica) (SBA-15) as a very attractive media for biocatalysts. Starch and cellulose are the main components of biomass, which is seen as an alternative raw material for ethanol production, i.e. second generation biofuels. Developing an effective biocatalyst for the conversion of biomass is the challenge of the XXI century.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>The secondary structure of the proteins can be divided into α-helix, βsheet and reverse turns. A reverse turn is defined as a site where a polypeptide chain reverses its overall direction. It leads the chain to fold back on itself by almost 180°. Another condition for defining this motif is the amount of amino acid residues involved in forming the turn that can not be greater then six and polypeptide chain in this region can not be in helical conformation [1]. Turns are classified as: γ-turn, β-turn, α-turn and π-turn, which are formed by 3-, 4-, 5- and 6- amino acid residues, respectively. Turns defined as “closed” are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the main chain carbonyl group from the first residue and the main chain amide group from the last residue in the turn. This results in formation of 7-, 10-, 13- and 16-membered pseudo-rings, respectively (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The other group of turns also stabilized by hydrogen bond, but conversely between the main chain amide group of the first residue and the carbonyl group of the last residue, are δ-turn (2-residues, 8-membered pseudo-ring) and ε-turn (3-residues, 11-membered pseudo-ring) (Fig. 2) [10–13]. These are seldom found in proteins. Turns are considered irregular structures due to the lack of clearly defined torsion angle preferences. because of that, each of the turn types can be further divided into several different subtypes (Table 1, 2 and 3) [1, 15, 31]. The “open” type structures are not stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but Cα-Cα distance between the first and the last residue in main chain is up to 10 Å [10].  As turns can be found mostly on the surface of the proteins they play the important role in folding processes, thus enabling the formation of the tertiary structure [2]. The turns are also responsible for the interactions between proteins, recognition processes and ligand-receptor interactions [3–8]. In the following article, the classification and characterization of the turn types is described. The particular attention was given to the γ and β turns, as these are most commonly found in proteins structure.    </p>",

Today, nucleic acids and their constituents are tools, which are used by molecular biology in medicine and biotechnology. Antisense and gene therapy are intensively developing methods for possible treating or preventing disease. They use short fragments of DNA or RNA - oligonucleotides to silence the genes expression. They are not the only ones that allow analytical chemists to obtain information about the state of our body. Determination of modified nucleoside allows detection of cancer, while analysis of nucleotides allows the estimation of strengthening the immune system.</p><p>There is a great need of sensitive, selective and precise methods of separation of nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides and their qualitative and quantitative analysis. Consequently liquid chromatography (LC) is the most commonly used for analysis of nucleic acid constituents. The most widely used modes of LC include Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEC) and Reversed Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP HPLC). Both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages in the analysis of nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides. In the case of IEC it is necessary to use high concentrations of the salt in the mobile phase or concentration gradients, which considerably limits the possibility of using MS detection. RP HPLC can be coupled with MS detection but only when volatile salts are mobile phase components. On the other hand there is a significant problem is the lack of sufficient selectivity for the most polar nucleosides and nucleotides. RP HPLC MS is still most often used in the determination of nucleosides and nucleotides, due to its high sensitivity and a comprehensive qualitative analysis.</p><p>Another system used for the HPLC analysis of oligonucleotides is Ion Pair Reversed Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (IP RP HPLC). These compounds can not be analyzed by RP HPLC due to their high polarity. The advantage of IP RP HPLC is selectivity, achieved by a suitable choice of mobile phase composition and the possibility of using MS. A disadvantage of IP RP HPLC in the analysis of oligonucleotides is however lower sensitivity compared to RP HPLC. </p><p>During the last few years Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) was applied for the separation of mixtures of nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides extracted from a biological or food samples. The presented results demonstrate the usefulness of this method, however, the resolving power is limited due to the asymmetric peak shape. On the other hand proper selection of the mobile and stationary phase can lead to a high selectivity in the analysis of the most polar nucleosides, nucleotides and oligonucleotides, which can not be separated by RP HPLC.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Chitosan is the most important derivative of chitin, a polysaccharide found in the exoskeleton of shellfish like shrimp and crab. It is a product of deacetylation of chitin under alkaline conditions or enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of chitin deacetylase. Both chitin and chitosan are linear polysaccharides and are chemically defined as copolymers consisting of varying amounts of β-(1→4)-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (GlcNAc) and 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (GlcN). The difference between chitin and chitosan lies in the content of GlcNAc and GlcN units. Chitin samples contain a high content of GlcNAc units. Due to excellent properties of chitosan, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, hydrophilicity, non-toxicity, cationicity, ease of modification, film forming ability, affinity to metals, protein and dyes, etc., this polymer has found applications in medicine and pharmacy, as food additive, antimicrobial agent, in paper and textile industry, in environmental remediation and other industrial areas. The presence of functional groups, reactive amino and hydroxyl groups, in chitosan backbone makes it suitable candidate for chemical modification. Chemical modification of chitosan to generate new polymers with useful physicochemical properties and distinctive biological functions is of key interest because it would not change the fundamental skeleton of the polymer. In this article the main three methods of chitosan modification: substitution reactions, reactions leading to the chain elongation and/or molecular weight increasing and methods of depolymerization are shortly characterized. Moreover, the selected methods of chitosan modification, i.e. quaternization, alkylation, acylation, carboxyalkylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, graft copolymerisation, crosslinking and depolymerization are discussed in more detail. A special attention is drawn to chitosan crosslinking with low and high molecular compounds. Chitosan modification by covalent and ionic crosslinking allows to obtain polymer materials with improved mechanical and chemical resistance and suitable for example for chitosan hydrogel membranes formation.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>His-tags are specific sequences containing six to nine subsequent histydyl residues and they are used commercially in immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as molecular ‘anchors’ that bind to a metal ion (usually nickel), immobilized by chelation with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) bound to a solid support [37, 38].  Consecutive histidines are the common denominator for both His-tags used in molecular biology and for quite remote biological phenomena – more than 2000 histidine-rich proteins (HRPs) are found in microorganisms including 60% and 82% of archaeal and bacterial species, respectively and their roles are not well characterized [73]. The physicochemical properties of histidine make it a versatile amino acid that influences protein conformation and enzymatic activity [15]. Many natural proteins with a His-tag domain are assigned to different functions, for example: most bacterial proteins, containing this motif are probably involved in the homeostasis of nickel ions [68, 76], while others, e.g. newly isolated peptides from the venom of the snake genus Atheris contain poly-histidyl-poly-glycyl sequences (pHpG) can act on the cardiovascular system by inhibiting snake venom metalloproteinases and affect its function by acting on specific receptors [58, 62]. His-rich motifs have been found also e.g. in Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporters, prion proteins, His-rich glycoproteins, transcription factors or numerous copper-binding proteins [56, 67, 84]. </p><p>Binding mode and the thermodynamic properties of the system depends on the specific metal ion and the histidine sequence. Despite the wide application of the His-tag for purification of proteins, little is known about the properties of metal-binding to such tag domain. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that metal ions, e.g. Cu<sup>2+</sup> can bind to various sets of imidazoles depending on the number of histidine residues that are located in His-rich sequences. The occurrence of polymorphic binding states and the formation of an α-helical structure induced by metal ion coordination suggest that proteins with a His-tag domain may serve as the dynamic site able to ‘move’ metal ions along the tag sequence [99, 100]. This might explain the frequent occurrence of such sequences in bacterial Ni<sup>2+</sup> chaperones, which transfer the metal ion between different proteins.</p>",

They define compartments, the communication between the inside and outside of the cell. The main components of biomembranes are lipids and proteins, which form protein-lipid bilayer systems [10]. A structure and physicochemical properties of protein-lipid membranes, which determines biological activities of biomembranes, are strongly dependent on interactions between lipid and protein components and external agents such as a temperature, pH, and a membrane hydration [4]. A lipid bilayer matrix serves as a perfect environment for membrane proteins (Fig. 1), and it assures activities of these proteins. Because biomembranes are composed of many different groups of lipids and proteins and have a complex structure, it is difficult to study in details their physicochemical properties using physicochemical methods. For these reason, lipid membranes of liposomes are used in many scientific laboratories for studding processes associated with a lipid phase transition, a membrane hydration, or protein-membrane interactions. The structure of liposomes (Fig. 5), and an influence of pH and an ionic strength on a lipid bilayer structure are discussed in the presented work. The role of membrane proteins in determination of biological activities of biomembranes is highlighted. A high variety of a structure and an enzymatic activity of membrane proteins is responsible for a high diversity of biological functions of cell membranes [2]. α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) is a peripheral membrane protein (Figs 8 and 9), its biological function is strongly related to its conformational structure and interaction with lipid membranes [49]. The complex of α-LA in a molten globule conformational state with oleic acid, termed as a HAMLET complex, are disused in a context of its anti-tumor activity.</p>",

However, for NIRS, there is a need to create a calibration model which will be precise for high diversity of samples.

Stanton Avery produced the first coating unit using a wooden cigar box with two holes cut in the bottom. PSAs can be defined as a special category of adhesive which in dry form are permanently tacky at room temperature [2, 6–8]. Since 1960s, silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives have found many uses. They are used in industrial plants, as tapes for joining materials with low surface energy, as well as in the sectors of electrical and electronic, medical care, health care and automotive industry. For about 10 years there has been great interest in new uses for the silicone PSA, particularly for medical and industrial belts.

Polymeric chains comprising the silicone resins include methyl and phenyl groups thus are very little reactive chemicals. In order to obtain the best adhesion-cohesion balance are used crosslinked thermally in a temperature range of 120–150°C by using organic peroxides. Peroxides most commonly used in industry benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl peroxide (DClBPO).

            "abstract": "<p>High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a method used to determine inorganic and organic substances in biological samples. Nevertheless, many analytes cannot be detected using HPLC method, because they do not contain a necessary chromophoric or fluophoric groups. Derivatization is the solution of this problem. This process can be defined as a conversion of analyte to corresponding derivative which possesses in its structure a moiety compatible with suitable detector [1, 2]. Reagent responsible for conversion of analyte to a derivative needs to meet a lot of requirements. It needs to be selective e.g. to react only with analysed substances and it should not generate by-products. The derivatization reagent should react rapidly, quantitatively, at lowest possible temperature and weakly pH, and the excess of reagent should be easily removable from reaction medium [1, 3, 5]. The derivatization can be carried out in pre-column, post-column and on-column mode. In the pre-column derivatization, analytes are derivatized before injection on HPLC system, and the reaction products are separated and detected. In the post-column derivatization, the reaction is performed automatically by adding the derivatization reagent after separation but before detection. The third method is based on reaction, which simultaneously proceeds with column separation [2, 3, 5, 6].</p><p>The derivatization processes in gas and liquid chromatography are subject matter among researcher from all over the world. The Polish literature has only few review articles on derivatization process in liquid chromatography [2, 4, 55]. The present article reviews derivatization techniques used in HPLC. Derivatization techniques used in gas chromatography are classified due to the chemical nature of derivatization reagent [3, 56]. Our attention is focused on the analyte and derivatization reagent, which can be react with various functional groups such as amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or carboxyl groups, occurring in the examined molecules. By chemically modification compounds into derivatives, they obtain necessary properties for chromatographic separation and accurate analysis.</p>",

Below the cloud point temperature (TCP) of the thermoresponsive polymer the layer is hydrophilic – it is hydrated and polymer chains adopt an expanded conformation.

Such thermoresponsive layers can be obtained via reactions of entities present on the surface (e.g. functional groups, radicals etc.) with complementary functionalities in the polymer chains (grafting to) or with monomer subjected to polymerization (grafting from).

Presence of polymers covalently bonded to substrates was confirmed by FT-IR and XPS studies. The polymer layers were 5-50 nm thick, depending on the molar mass and polymer concentration. Microscopic techniques indicated a smooth surface of mPGl layers, slightly rough texture of PENOx layers and fibrille-like fibers surface of PIPOx layers. Ellipsometry and contact angle studies revealed the response of layers to temperature changes. Biocompatibility of layers with dermal fibroblasts was confirmed by toxicity tests. Thermoresponsive surfaces were employed as substrates for skin cell culture and harvesting. Fibroblasts adhesion and proliferation on investigated surfaces was comparable with control sample. A confluent cell sheet was formed after 24 hours of culture. The influence of surface properties on cell adhesion and proliferation was examined. Detachment of cells from surfaces was controlled by variation of the temperature. An intact monolayer of cultured dermal fibroblasts was detached. No mechanical or enzymatic methods were required to harvest the cell sheets. Skin cell sheets, detached from thermoresponsive polymer layers may be applied in the cell sheet engineering that is highly desirable in tissue regeneration.</p>",

In atherosclerosis, in the space between the endothelium and the muscular layer in the wall of a blood vessel, accumulates deposits consisting of macrophages, lipoprotein, low density foam cells and extracellular concentrations of cholesterol. In this way fatty streaks are formed which are early stage atheroscle- rotic lesions. With the passage of time they are joined by elements of fibrous connec- tive tissue that undergo hypertrophy.

            "abstract": "<p>In the last decade a change of thought has taken place in the pharmaceutical industry which has led to a renaissance of the Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) [1]. Under the inspiration of diversity-oriented-synthesis (DOS), numerous efforts have been devoted to find powerful synthetic tools for rapidly accessing maximum molecular diversity with minimum cost. In the toolbox enabling DOS for genera- ting molecular libraries, MCRs are now recognized as one of the most useful and  powerful strategies [2], which provide the highest number of compounds for the  least synthetic effort [3]. Following the rapid progress in the research area of MCRs, widespread application has been found in many different areas such as chemical biology, natural product synthesis, pharmaceuticals as well as agrochemistry [2].</p><p>The overall aim of a DOS is to generate a small-molecule collection with a high degree of structural, and thus functional, diversity that interrogates large areas of chemical space simultaneously [4]. In Targed-Oriented Synthesis (TOS) a complex target is transformed into a sequence of progressively simpler structures by formally performing chemical reactions in the reverse-synthetic direction [3].</p><p>Special subclasses are isocyanide based MCRs (IMCRs). They are particularly interesting because they are more versatile and diverse than the remaining MCRs. Today most MCRs chemistry performed with isocyanides relates to the classical reactions of Passerini and Ugi (Scheme  1)[5].</p><p>In Ugi four-component reaction (U-4CR), carboxylic acids, primary amines and oxo components (aldehydes or ketones) react with isocyanides in polar solvents to obtain α-amino carboxamides (Schemes 2 and 3). Occasionally however, selective conversion of amide groups into other functional groups is desirable for an increase of diversity of the IMCR-derived compounds [6].</p><p>In this reaction two substituted amide groups are formed under release of one equivalent of water. Thus, the U-4CR is an atom-economic and environmentally friendly reaction. It was also shown that water can be used as the solvent. This reac- tion is typically performed by stirrling the components for approximately  1 day      in small quantities of a protic solvent (e.g. methanol or trifluoroethanol) [7]. The examples of Ugi reactions are described in the Schemes 4–10.</p><p>Multicomponent reactions have become attractive tools in modern synthetic organic chemistry. Among their many advantages, they allow the creation of large chemical libraries of diverse, complex molecular structures, starting from simple  materials within a short time frame. Not surprisingly, these particular features have made MCRs especially appealing to medicinal chemists [8].</p>",

(For example d-mannitol is used as a diuretic agent or in osmotherapy to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure; isosorbide mononitrate is used against angina pectoris. Xylitol (pentitol) can counteract several diseases,  among others, the acute otitis media, osteoporosis, tooth decay and helps the remi- neralization of teeth, thanks to that it found use as an additive to chewing gum    [4]. Most alditols including d-mannitol, d-glucitol and 1,4-anhydro-d,l-galactitol, are used as sweeteners and as well as additives for low caloric food or as diets for  diabeties. Although they show lower sweetness than glucose or saccharose, their great advantage is that it does not cause a rapid increase of glucose level in blood  [5,6]. While nitrates 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-d-mannitol and 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-d-gluci- tol thanks to the ability of blood vessels relaxant are commonly used for years in the treatment of heart diseases and blood system [10]).

Hence, a deter- mination of their structure at different levels of organization is still one of the most important tasks in many research projects. A study of lipid-protein systems is based on many physicochemical techniques, such as spectroscopy of FTIR, Raman, fluo- rescence, NMR, EPR, as well as DLS, DSC and TEM methods. In the presented paper tow of the most frequently used methods, that is FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy, will be discussed in details. They are characterized by a relatively low cost of sample preparation, a short measuring time, and they give a huge number    of structural and physicochemical information about lipid-protein systems. In the FTIR-ATR spectroscopy many of vibrational bands are commonly used as very pre- cise vibrational indicators of structural changes in lipids and proteins (Fig. 1) [1–6]. They allows to characterize lipid and protein components separately in mixed sys- tems. Additionally, structural changes in lipid membranes can be monitored in one FTIR-ATR experiment simultaneously in a region of hydrophilic lipid head-groups (Fig. 5) [17, 18], in a hydrophobic part composed of hydrocarbon lipid chains (see Figures 2 and 3) [7–9], and in a lipid membrane interface represented by ester lipid groups (Fig. 4) [4, 6, 11, 12]. A secondary structure of proteins and peptides in diffe- rent experimental conditions can be defined in the FTIR-ATR spectroscopy on the base of amide I bands (Fig. 6 and Tabs 1, 2 and 3) [20–22]. A fluorescence spectro- scopy is a complementary methods to FTIR spectroscopy in a study of lipid-protein systems. It  competes information about time-dependent and very fast (in a scale     of femtoseconds) structural processes in both lipids [41–45] and proteins [23, 27, 48].

            "abstract": "<p>In early twentieth century, it was already known that chemical compounds might be chiral without containing the chiral atoms. The presence of the stereogenic center is a sufficient but not necessary condition that the molecule appears in two forms which are mirror images. In certain cases, the limit of free rotation in the molecule may result in asymmetry, e.g. inhibition of rotation around single bond leads to axial isomers. This is the kind of conformational isomerism, which according to the nomenclature is called atropisomerism [1, 2]. The most often optically active molecules without stereogenic atoms, possessing an axial chirality are biaryls, which are commonly found in nature. In most cases, pharmacological activity of biaryls is associated with the presence of axial chirality (Figs 1, 2; Scheme 1) [1–14]. Generally chiral biaryls are divided into bridged biaryls (Scheme 4–6) [15–24], and biaryls, which do not contain the additional ring (Scheme 2, 3) [25–33]. The thermal stability of both enantiomeric/diastereomeric forms is an essential precondition for atropisomerism. For a given temperature, conformationally stable isomers may coexist when their a half-life is at least 1000 s, which gives the minimum energy barrier of 93 kJ mol–1 at 300 K. Chiral biaryls can be achieved by either desymmetrization of stable but achiral biaryls by modifying one of the groups on the aromatic moiety (Scheme 7–9) [1, 34, 35], or by dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of the conformationally unstable chiral substrates. The synthesis of the chirally stable biaryls from the chiral labile substrates is most frequently the result of the extra substituent addition (Scheme 10) [36], and formation or cleavage of a bridge (Scheme 11–16) [37–54]. The axially chiral biaryls can also be obtained in the atroposelective transformation of the alkyl substituent of the arene ring into a second aromatic ring in the presence of an organometallic catalyst (Scheme 17, 18) [55, 56].</p>",

The selected complex compounds of copper(II) with ligands which are organic and inorganic species have been characterized taking into account their physico-chemical properties.

Nowadays tested coordination compounds of copper(II) have interesting antibacterial activities against bacteria strains that are antagonistic to the human. The antibacterial activity of copper(II) complex is stronger than some of the known antibacterial substances e.g. ciprofloxacin. In addition, copper(II) complex compounds exhibit a 64-fold greater antimicrobial properties than copper(II) chloride. Moreover, these compounds have antifungal and antioxidant properties.

In the absence of natural scaffold, or absence of its artificial substitute, regeneration is not possible.</p><p>The advantage of natural building blocks to create new scaffolds results from the requirements of the materials structures used for tissue regeneration: biocompatibility, biodegradability, lack of cytotoxicity and desirable mechanical properties. Application of these building blocks for the preparation of three dimensional materials should ensure completely biocompatibility of the temporary extracellular matrix equivalent, thus offering construct resembling a natural milieu for the cells and finally regeneration of tissues. These include framework with elements stimulating adhesion of in vitro grown cells, growth factors, hormones and vitamins offered as a completed ingredients in the commercially available culture media. 3D frameworks applied for cell growing should facilitate formation of required tissue shape and size as well as appropriate functioning of the cells. The key factor for the successful regeneration of tissues is the function of the scaffold determining the environment for growing cells, directing proliferation and regulating differentiation processes. The basic feature of the cellular scaffold, determining its functioning is porosity. Pore diameter and their abundance consists a critical factor for penetration of cells into the interior of the implant and finally for successful regeneration of damaged tissue. The progress of tissue regeneration in vitro depends on the presence of cytokines and growth factors, which are controlling cell differentiation process. Nowadays neither of implant material offered on the market has a property comparable to the natural tissue. However, there are many reports presenting preliminary experiments conducted towards attaining novel supports for regenerative medicine derived from peptides and formed by their self-organization. The most advanced of them are known under trade name PuraMatrix, which recently were applied for the regeneration of soft tissues. However, due to tendency of this materials for hydrogels formation, characteristic for them are disadvantageous mechanical properties. The alternative approach based on application of native ECM proteins was also taken into consideration. The weak points of this materials are the susceptibility of proteins towards proteolytic enzymes and theirs immunogenic properties.

            "abstract": "<p>The recent decade brought about new dimensions to materials developments; stimuliresponse materials capable of responding to internal or external stimuli. The ability of materials to autonomously self-heal is the most promising property [1]. The number of publications that appeared in the past decade concerning the self-repair of polymeric materials is quite extensive. They cover different fields of research, inclu­ding thermoplastic and thermoset polymers, polymer composites, and coatings. The first ideas already started to develop in the 1990s, when scientists started to look at nature to solve the recurring problem of damage to materials [2]. </p><p>The process of implementing a strategy of autorepair of a damage is a subject of increasing interest. One of the challenges for many of the already developed self­-repairing systems is to enhance the structural stability and mechanical properties of the materials. The first developed self-healing materials relied on microencapsulated healing agents within the bulk polymer [3]. Upon mechanical stress, the microcap­sules were ruptured releasing agents that reacted with the catalyst in the polymer matrix to repair the damage [4–5]. Among many other crosslinking methods relying mainly on epoxy chemistry, ‘click’-based chemistry, the use of thiolene-based systems, as well as catalytic crosslinking reactions based on ring opening metathesis polyme­rization have found wide application in materials science. In the latter methodology, the catalyst present inside the matrix then promotes an autorepair reaction via ROMP. Thermosetting autorepair polymers which have been proposed so far include Grubbs’ first-generation catalyst; currently, the possibility of applying other ruthenium cata­lysts such as second-generation Grubbs’ catalyst and Hoveyda–Grubbs’ second-gene­ration catalyst are under evaluation [3]. In addition to the aforementioned methods, you can also find self-healing coatings in the reaction of Diels-Alder. </p><p>The self-healing concept envisages a similar recovery of material properties, such as fracture toughness, corrosion resistance, or conductivity, to improve the durability and reliability of the polymer materials. Damage due to impact, wear or fatigue ini­tiates a healing mechanism that preferentially without external stimulus can recover any functionality. Researchers working in the field of self-healing polymeric mate­rials mainly focus on high-end applications where the added value outweighs the cost of production. Such applications can, for example, be found in the transport sector, electronics, and structural materials. Car coatings, structural composites in airplanes, conductive polymers in sensors are only some examples of many targeted applica­tions. Repair of damage in these materials is often laborious, not cost-efficient and only detected on the macroscopic level when it is too late. On the other hand, self­-healing materials try to avoid macroscopic failure by responding immediately or at least fast enough to damage [1]. </p>",

The broad spectrum of biological activity of 2,7-naph­thyridine derivatives [1] is the main of reason for obtaining of the new compounds containing this scaffold (Fig. 1). Gabriel and Colman were the first to obtain isomer 2,7-naphthyridine in 1902 and they called it ‘copiryne’ (Fig. 2) [2]. The goal of this study is the presentation of various methods for the preparation of 2,7-naphthyridine derivatives. Compounds containing copyrine scaffold can be obtained from a diffe­rent substrates, but that synthesis may be classified into three main categories: from pyridine derivatives, from quinoline derivatives and from other compounds. Most of 2,7-naphthyridines have been synthesized by cyclocondensation (Scheme 5, 7–10, 13–14, 16–18, 20, 28–29, 32, 35–36) or intramolecular cyclization (Scheme 1–4, 6, 11–12, 15, 19, 21–25, 30–31, 33–34, 38) of pyridine derivatives by annulation of the other pyridine ring [3–24, 27–31]. Intramolecular rearrangement of pyrrolo[3,4-c] pyridines (Scheme 26–27) and pyrano[3,4-c]pyridine or thiopyrano[3,4-c]pyridine (Scheme 35–37) also gave the 2,7-naphthyridine scaffold [32-34]. There are also many syntheses of benzo[c][2,7]naphthyridine, benzo[f][2,7]naphthyridine or ben­zo[c,f][2,7]naphthyridine scaffolds, in which the substrates are quinoline derivatives (Scheme 39–48) [35–43]. 2,7-naphthyridines have been least often obtained by cyc­locondensation of non-cyclic substrates (Scheme 49–53) [44–49]. </p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Olefin metathesis is one of the most important synthetic tools, both in organic and olefin chemistry. Olefin metathesis allows to shorten production time of organic compounds and it is characterized by a smaller amount of by-products and waste in comparison with the classical ways of the synthesis of these compounds. Simultane­ously, the conditions at which metathesis is performed are environmentally friendly. This method allows obtaining very valuable compounds, such as: anti-inflamma­tory agents, fungicides and many others. This causes that olefin metathesis has an important place in the organic synthesis and develops constantly. </p><p>The first catalysts had undefined structure, therefore, it was difficult to predict the mechanism of their action. Big development metathesis came with the synthesis of catalysts with a clearly defined structure. This article explains what olefin meta­thesis is and shows applications of olefin metathesis. This work presents catalysts, which possess transition metal in the structure, such as: ruthenium, molybdenum or tungsten. It also shows the comparison of catalysts possess ruthenium (Grubbs catalyst first and second generation and Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst) taking into acco­unt their structure and properties. This work describe carbenes, which improve thermal stability of catalysts compare with complexes containing phosphine. </p><p>Researchers receive new compounds through modifications on the NHC ligand. In this work are presented modifications of the NHC ligand complexes of ruthenium described in the literature and their influence on such catalytic pro­perties as: activity, selectivity, and efficiency. Modifications concern: heteroatoms, bulky groups and groups, which change electron density. Despite many studies and receiving large amounts of catalysts for this reaction, still a problem is the obtaining of an universal catalyst for all types transitions, that would have a high activity, high efficiency and which could be easily recovered after the reaction. </p>",

            "abstract": "<p>The triel bonds are analyzed and compared with the hydrogen bond interaction. The triel bonds belong to the class of interactions that are named as the σ-hole and π-hole bonds. The σ-hole bond is an interaction between the σ-hole characterized by the positive electrostatic potential and the electron rich regions such as lone electron pairs, π-electron systems, in other words, centers paying a role of Lewis bases. The σ-holes may be observed for elements of the 14–18 groups of the periodic system and the corresponding interactions with Lewis bases are named; tetrel, pnicogen, chalcogen, halogen and aerogen bonds, respectively. On the other hand, π-holes also characterized by the positive electrostatic potential are observed for centers in planar molecules or planar fragments of molecules in regions above those planes. π-holes may be attributed to triel centers (13th group of the periodic system). The boron and aluminium trihydrides and trihalides are examples of molecules where triels are characterized by π-holes. </p><p>The mechanism of the triel bond formation is very similar to the mechanism of the formation of the hydrogen bond. It is the Lewis acid – Lewis base interaction where the electron charge transfer from the base unit to the acid one is observed. Next there is outflow of the electron charge from the triel center to the other parts of the Lewis acid unit; in other words the positive charge of the triel center increases as a result of complexation. The triel bonds are often very strong and often they possess characteristics of typical covalent bonds; this is confirmed by the QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) approaches. For example, for the triel bonds the bond paths between the triel center and the Lewis base center are observed with the bond critical points (BCPs) attributed to those paths. Similarly for the A-H…B hydrogen bonds the H…B bond paths are observed. The parameters of those BCPs often indicate the covalent character of the triel bonds and analogously those characteristics for H-bonds may also indicate the covalent character of the latter interactions. </p><p>It is very interesting that the triel bonds are observed experimentally in the real systems; for example in crystal structures. The triel center which is trivalent and possesses the trigonal configuration is hypovalent; it means that the octet rule is not obeyed here because of the valence electrons´ deficiency (the triel center possesses six valence electrons in such species). Thus it may interact with one Lewis base ligand reaching rather stable octet and tetrahedral configuration. If the trivalent triel center interacts with two Lewis base ligands thus it may lead to the configuration of the trigonal bipyramid with the hypervalent and pentavalent triel center. These kinds of the triel species occur in crystal structures that are described here.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Modern computational chemistry offers a wide variety of methods allowing us to investigate very complex systems. In the current study, we would like to focus on ab initio and classical molecular dynamics to show their applications in our research. Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) was carried out to study compounds possessing intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Our simulations were performed in vacuum, in solvent and in crystalline phase. It is well known that intramolecular hydrogen bonding stabilizes 3D structure of molecules. The strength of the bonding and its features are influenced by inductive and steric effects. Our short overview on CPMD application to systems with intramolecular HB we start from Schiff and Mannich bases -model compounds to investigate intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Other examples reported here derive from the class of N-oxide type compounds. Special attention was devoted to another representative structure in such investigations – picolinic acid N-oxide. In some examples listed above proton transfer phenomena occurred making these compounds interesting objects for future excited state studies. Aliphatic boronic acid was used as a model example to study intermolecular hydrogen bonds based on CPMD method. Further, classical molecular dynamics was applied to investigate proteins. Here, we would like to report our results for two biomolecules. The first one is proteinase K for which the impact of mercury(II) on its catalytic center was studied. The second one is streptavidin. For the latter one its complexes with biotinylated ligands were investigated. We close our review with a paragraph describing further development and perspectives related to CPMD method.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Classical view on the substituent effect (SE) is associated with an empiric approach presented 80-years ago by Hammett [1]. He proposed a simple formula to represent the effect of a substituent upon the rate or equilibrium constants of a reaction in which the reacting group is in a side chain attached to the ring and introduced quantitative descriptors of the SE named substituent constants σ, defined in terms of dissociation constants of meta- and para- substituted benzoic acids. Then the Hammett’s equation relied on using them to describe SE for various physicochemical properties, P(X), by means of linear regression like P(X)=ρ·σ, where ρ is so called reaction constants describing sensitivity of a system in question on the SE. Application of the quantum chemistry modeling allowed to find descriptors (independent of empirical approaches) which are characterized by clear physical meaning and are accessible by use of standard computational packages.</p><p>The oldest descriptor is based on homodesmotic reaction [X-R-Y + R = R-X + R-Y] in which energy of products is subtracted from that of substrates [32]. The model is named as SESE (substituent effect stabilization energy) and its values are usually well correlated with empirical constants σ, or their modifications.</p><p>Ten years ago Sadlej-Sosnowska introduced [23, 24] an effective descriptor of SE based on atomic charges of a substituent X and the ipso carbon atom named cSAR(X) (charge of the substituent active region). Unlike atomic charges at substituent, q(X), the cSAR(X) values correlate well with the Hammett substituent constants [25].</p><p>Recently as an interesting and showing new aspects descriptor of SE appeared a model making use of population of electrons at sigma and pi orbitals of planar pi-electron systems (or their fragments), named as sEDA and pEDA [33]. Again in particular cases these descriptors correlate with the Hammett σ. This descriptor allowed to reveal how strong is SE on population of pi-electron systems in substituted derivatives of benzene, and how much is this different for para and meta substituted species. Analysis of the relation of pEDA vs sEDA for meta and para substituted derivatives of nitrobenzene revealed that sEDA values increase with a decrease of electronegativity of the linking atom [47]. The above mentioned action of the sigma structure is modulated by the remaining part of the substituent as well as its pi-electron structure. This part of substituents (including also the linking atom) is responsible for an interplay of the sigma structure with the pi-electron one.</p><p>Application of cSAR(X) for series of meta- and para- substituted phenol and phenolate derivatives [36] revealed that reverse substituent effect, i.e. the effect of impact of the functional group Y on the electron accepting/donating power of the substituent in systems like X-R-Y may be as large as the overall differences in these kind of properties between NO and NMe2! In the σ constants scale this is full range of σ for uncharged substituents, 1.73 units of σ.</p><p>Application of cSAR for CH2 groups in 1-X-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivatives and using the regression of cSAR(CH<sub>2</sub>) against cSAR(X) values allowed to document that substituent effect in these systems is inductive in nature [39].</p><p>In summary, substituent effect descriptors based on quantum chemistry modeling are usually consistent with the empirical ones, but are able to present more detailed information on physical aspects of the problem.</p>",

Intermolecular dipolar couplings and hydrogen bonds are the most common interactions in liquids leading to formation of multimolecular entities with various structures. The natural rival of these interactions is the thermal agitation of molecules (kT), which aims to destroy the emerging structures. In this paper we present an experimental method to estimate the way of molecular self-assembly resulting from the simultaneous action of kT and intermolecular interactions. The method is based on the study of dipolar orientation effects induced by an applied electric field. As an experimental source of the information on these effects is temperature derivative of the static permittivity of tested liquid. That derivative is proportional to the liquid entropy change due to the ordering action of the electric field on the molecular dipoles. Here, we present the experimental results on temperature dependence of the static permittivity and increment of the orientation entropy of liquids where the self-association process realizes with two ways: dipolar couplings and hydrogen-bonds.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>The molecular crystals, which are built of organic or organic-inorganic molecules, are characterized by the weak intermolecular interactions. From the viewpoint of the potential applications in electronics or optoelectronics the electric properties of the crystals are essential. In turn these properties are related to their crystal structure as well as the dynamics of the molecules in the solid state. The existence of the hydrogen bonds in the crystal structures, conventional and unconventional, is crucial from the viewpoint of the electric properties of the crystals. The dynamics of methyl groups present in the structure can be a measure of the molecular interactions in the crystals. In this work the dynamical properties, first of all taking into account the research results concerning the neutron scattering, will be discussed. The neutron technique is very effective as regards the methyl group dynamics investigations. The relationship between a formation of the conventional and unconventional hydrogen bonds and a tunneling of the methyl groups at low temperature will be discussed. The method of the interpretation of the INS spectra will be described taking into account the theoretical model, the parameters of which are fitted to the experimental data. The examples will regard the following molecular crystals: p-N,N’-1,10-tetraacethyldiaminodurene (TADD) (Figs. 2 and 4), 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine with chloranilic acid (TMP·CLA) (Figs. 5, 6 and 7), 2,3,5,6- tetramethylpyrazine with bromanilic acid (TMP·BRA) (Figs. 5 and 6) and the crystal of 3,4,7,8-tetramethylphenantroline (Me4phen) and its complex with picric acid (Me4phen·PIC) (Figs. 8 and 9).

These substances are characterized by a high tendency to self-associate through the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to the presence in their structure both groups as donors (NH) as well as proton acceptors (C=O) or (C=S). Studies were performed by using IR spectroscopy, method of measuring the average molecular weight and the dipole moments. The experimental data were verified by DFT quantum chemical calculations with B3PW91 correlation functional. Simultaneous use of these techniques alowed establishing not only the efficiency of aggregation, but also the structure and polarity of formed aggregates. It was shown, that in solvents with weak acidic C-H groups the aggregation was strongly limited because of molecular interactions between solute and solvent.</p><p>The theoretical DFT calculations which included the impact of the environment on the nature of interactions in the complex were carried out [e.g. Scheme 4.1.4]. A combination of geometry optimization in polarizable continuum model (PCM) with the connection of chloroform molecules (1,2-dichloroethane) with urea dimers enabled to obtain the expected theoretical simulation compliance with the experiment.</p><p>The equilibrium constants were calculated on the basis of data obtained in two independent methods of measurement: IR spectroscopy and measurements of average molecular weights. Good agreement of experimental data of both research techniques were found up to concentration of 0.03 mol/dm3 [Fig. 2.5]. The type of associates have been assessed following the dipole moments measured as a function of concentration, and on the results of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations on the structure and energy of particular species. All of the urea derivatives demonstrated an increase in dipole moment with increased concentration, suggesting linear-type aggregation [Fig. 4.1.3]. Contrastingly, the dipole moments of the N,N-dimethylthiourea and mono-N-alkyl-substituted thioureas decreased with concentration and suggest that cyclic dimers or trimers are formed by C=S…(HR)<sub>2</sub>N-C=S interactions [Fig. 4.2.2]. The efficiency of self-aggregation was described by use of two equilibrium constants. The first constant, K<sub>1</sub>, was describing dimer formation and the second constant, K<sub>2</sub>, the subsequent multimer formation. In N,N’-thioureas aggregation was lower than for the related urea compounds [Table 4.1.1 and Table 4.2.1].</p><p>Differences between urea and thiourea derivatives result from the fact that the ureas are stronger bases and, therefore, more active in aggregation.</p>",

The chemistry of betaines has become a subject of particular interest due to their applications in biological research, especially with regard to their important role in aminoacid synthesis as methyl transfer agents. The crystals of many betaine complexes display interesting physical properties, exhibiting phase transitions with ferroelectric, antiferroelctric and ferroelastic behavior. Betaines containing a hydrophobic chain in the range of 8–20 carbon atoms show the unique properties characteristic for amphoteric surfactants and their current industrial application is in toiletries and personal care products.</p><p>The conformational structure of zwitterionic molecules depends on several factors. The electrostatic attraction between two charged groups depends strongly on arm flexibility (energy differences between rotational trans and gauche isomers), bulkiness and hydration of charged groups preventing their close approach, solvent and arm electrical properties which control electrostatic attraction between two opposite charged groups, and polarization of solvent around the molecule caused by the dielectric discontinuity between solvent and solute interior (image charge effect). Electrostatic interaction is the common determinant and probably the most important element in structure-reactivity correlation in organic and biological systems. On the other hand, organic compounds are thought to be pure even though they may be a mixture of conformational isomers. This is because the isomers covert rapidly with each other at room temperature and their individual reactivates are little known.

            "abstract": "<p>Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides able to efficiently cross cel- lular membrane. The group includes great diversity of sequences and besides capa- bility to enter various types of cells, their characteristic feature is lack of toxicity. CPPs can be divided according to their origin (natural and synthetic) or according to their physicochemical properties responsible for the cellpenetrating ability (catio- nic, amphipathic and hydrophobic). </p><p>Properties of CPPs are closely related to their mechanism of internalisation. Endocytic pathway is probably the dominating mechanism for majority of CPPs, but less common energyindependent internalisation (occurring via inverted micelle, carpet-like, barrel stave pore or toroidal pore model may also play a relevant part in the uptake across membranes. </p><p>CPPs have been applied in transporting various compounds. They are very effective in delivering small molecules (fluorophores, drugs, peptides), macromo- lecules (proteins, nucleic acids) and even nanoparticles (metal nanoparticles, lipo- somes). Conjunction of CPP and cargo can be achieved either covalently (peptide bond, sulphide bridge etc.) or noncovalently (electrostatic or hydrophobic interac- tion, hydrogen bonding). </p><p>Ability to unspecific enter almost any kind of cell and tissue becomes a great problem in the case of in vivo applications. Another disadvantage of CPPs is their low plasma stability. Many strategies have been suggested to overcome these issues. Selectivity can be improved by attaching targeting ligands (e.g. short peptides, anti- bodies, proteins, folic acid or hyaluronic acid) or by incorporating CPPs into macro- molecular drug carriers, which exploit the so called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The most recent and most sophisticated way of improving CPPs’ stability and selectivity is the synthesis of activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs). The deactivating moiety may consist of anionic sequence, polymer chain or smaller protecting groups. The deactivating parts are connected to the delivery system via linker that can be cleaved under conditions characteristic for the site of action. ACPPs may be activated by enzymes, pH and oxidative potential change, temperature or radiation. </p><p>CPPs may find application in tumour therapy, diagnostics and the combination of both – theranostics. Despite many successful studies in delivering drugs and tags in vivo and in vitro, CPPs have passed only few clinical trials (some are being run currently). It is sure that this research area will develop in next years. </p>",

The mechanism of action depends on interaction of compounds with the nicotinamide quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). The 5,8-quinolinedione can be reduced by the NAD(P)H as a cofactor to form the semiquinone or hydroquinone intermediates. These compounds can react with oxygen yielding a regenerated 5,8-quinolinedione fragment and creating the hydroxyl radicals, which are ultimately responsible for the DNA strands cleavage. </p><p>The structure–activity relationship study has shown that the most important part of the molecule is the 5,8-quinolinedione moiety.

This involves a significant increase in the interest in natural ingredients in a human daily diet. They come from both vegetable and animal products. This group of substances includes, for example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), tocopherol (vitamin E), vitamin D, coenzyme Q10 and others. The important role of many compounds provided with food is their antioxidant action, which protects the body against the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species. They also exhibit therapeutic effects in diseases caused by oxidative stress. α-Lipoic acid (LA) also fits well into this group of substances and even gains the title of an “universal antioxidant” and an “antioxidant of antioxidants”.</p><p>LA is produced in the human body in small amounts, and its biosynthesis occurs in the mitochondria. It is a compound with a very broad spectrum of therapeutic and biological activity. The amounts produced in the body are not sufficient and should therefore be supplied to the body from external sources. Food is the second, except de novo synthesis, the source of this compound. LA is a great antioxidant that can counteract the effects of aging. It is used mainly in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and cardiovascular diseases, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>Such a wide action and occurrence causes the development of determination methods. Literature data indicate that free LA is primarily determined by liquid and gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, spectrophotometric and electrochemical techniques. In plant and animal cells it is mainly in the form of lipoyllysine. Determination of such a bound LA requires the proper preparation of the sample. This is usually acid, alkaline or enzymatic hydrolysis.</p><p>This review summarizes the basic physicochemical and biochemical properties of α-lipoic acid and the methods of its determination.</p>",

In 1935, the concept of self-adhesive glue, wherein the obtained self-adhesive product of the invention R. Stanton Avery, was firstly developed. From many types of adhesives, the most common adhesives are acrylics pressure-sensitive adhesives [1–3].</p><p>In most cases, self-adhesive adhesives do not exhibit good conductive properties, whereas conductivity grades are classified in the group of insulators. In order to improve their conductive properties, studies have been conducted on the modification of polymers in adhesive compositions, where at least one of the components exhibited conductive properties (e.g. polymers with conjugated π-bonded polymers along polymeric chains). However, the best effects were obtained by adding conductive fillers such as metal (copper, aluminum), specially modified soot, nanotubes or graphene, carbon fibers, metallized glass and conductive fibers. This allowed the creation of electrically conductive compositions characterizing by conductivity in the range from 10<sup>–2</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> S/cm. This relatively high conductivity is the result of the percolation of conductive filler molecules into an insulating matrix or tunneling between electrically conductive molecules [10, 11].</p><p>Acrylate pressure-sensitive adhesives with conductive fillers have found a number of important industrial applications, especially in the electronics industry. Pressure-sensitive adhesives, such as self-adhesive tapes or adhesive films, are used as heating elements, sensors or conductive gums. Due to their good performance, they can be used to connect solar panels or glue small components in the microelectronics industry. They also can be used to discharge static charges from the surface – used as flexible drainage connections – especially in places where the spark is undesirable and can be dangerous. They are used as heating elements [10, 12, 27].</p>",

For this reason, ionophores are commonly used in veterinary medicine as the non-hormonal growth-promoting as well as coccidiostatic agents. </p><p>In this group particularly interesting are monensin and salinomycin (Fig. 1) because of their proved anti-tumour activity, including efficiency against multidrug-resistant cancer cells and cancer stem cells of different origin. Improved synthetic derivatives of both polyether ionophores are thus of considerable current interest. Selective derivatization of these structures whose display multiple reactive functional groups and, in the case of salinomycin, a sensitive tricyclic spiroketal ring system is however non-trivial. Even so, semi-synthetic analogs reported to date includes i.a. selective derivatization of the carboxyl group, the three hydroxyl groups, the ketone group, the alkene, and epimerization of the characteristic tricyclic salinomycin unit (for more details see: M.

            "institute": "",
            "abstract": "<p>elf-adhesive adhesives have been known since 1935. Since then, many categories of their division have been distinguished, depending on their origin, state of aggregation, operating conditions, obtaining, chemical base or binding mechanism, as well as many other properties. The main is their application in natural and synthetic adhesives, that is due to the origin of the high molecular weight compounds used for their production. The following work describes the types of water-soluble natural and synthetic adhesives. In recent centuries, there has been a decline in the use of natural polymers for the synthesis of water-soluble pressure sensitive adhesives. This is due to the spread of cheaper products from petrochemical resources, but also better properties that they characterize. For their polymerization, synthetic monomers which hydrophilic groups (hydroxyl, amide or carboxyl) are used. These groups, in the further reaction stage, after polymerisation, give the possibility of cross-linking of the pressure-sensitive adhesive.</p><p>Polyacrylate based adhesives are among the most commonly used adhesives. It is forecasted that the demand for such adhesives will increase on average by 2.9% per annum. Dispersive, water-soluble, self-adhesive adhesives and those in which the solvent is water also play an increasingly important role. This happens as a result of legal requirements, but also greater public awareness of ecology.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Free flow electrophoresis, or carrier-free electrophoresis, is a technique based upon the principle of mobility of chargeable species in the electric field. However, unlike more widespread gel electrophoresis, free flow electrophoresis does not utilise any kind of solid support medium. Instead, species to be separated move within the space filled with aqueous buffer, which is constantly pumped in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. Such set-up allows for continuous separation, as compounds of the sample being processed form separate bands and leave the separation system through several different outlets located along the edge of the chamber. Furthermore, the use of mild separation conditions increases the chance of biologically active compounds retaining their activity after the separation is finished. These qualities make free flow electrophoresis an excellent tool for protein research and cytology.</p><p>In this review, the basic theoretical aspects of the technique are outlined, with a special emphasis placed on various modes in which free flow electrophoresis can be operated. Besides, a review of milestone papers related to free flow electrophoresis technology is presented. Apart from the devices following the original concept of Barrollier and Hannig, an insight into the construction of recirculating instrumentation, multicompartment electrolysers as well as radially-symmetric chambers is provided. A special focus is placed on patents and commercialized solutions. Finally, the challenges of scaling-down free flow electrophoresis to micro-dimensions are introduced.</p>",

An interesting example of such analyses are investigations of microscopic fibers and particles taken previously from areas attributed to the blood on the Shroud of Turin. Detailed analyses performed by a number of research groups published in 2015–2017 are reviewed. They confirmed previous hypothesis on blood authenticity and discovered new evidences indicated a violence hidden behind the death. In particular, the presence of old red blood cells was documented by Lucotte [20], of bile pigment biliverdin by Laude and Fanti [28], of iron oxide cores of ferritin bounded to nanoparticles of creatinine by Carlino et al. [31]. The last result is typical for patients with severe polytrauma indicating at the unexpected nonoscopic level a tremendous suffering of the victim wrapped in the Shroud of Turin. Bigger particles of mineral pigments: ochre (iron oxide) and vermillion (mercury sulfide) were also found but they can be easily distinguished form blood particles using environmental electron microscopy ESEM with the back-scattered electrons detector [24]. The statistical analysis of a sample composition made by Fanti and Zagotto [24] indicated that 90–95% of the observed volume corresponds to the blood and only remainder represents inorganic pigments. Thus, it was proposed [24] that the original human blood on Shroud stains was much later reinforced by red pigments using a color dust without any binder and this hypothesis can easily explain controversies between previous results of different researches. </p>",

The use of waste of plant origin to obtain energy reduces the amount of greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere, which results from the fact that plants take CO2 in the process of photosynthesis. Plants are a carbon reservoir, which in turn allows the use of biomass to obtain biofuels. In addition, the use of waste to obtain energy, solves the problem of storage, which is particularly problematic in the case of tires and plastics, which pose a potential threat to the natural environment. The article describes the composition of waste used for thermal processes and explains why waste is a good source of energy. In addition, it presents the division of thermal processes into three types: combustion, gasification and pyrolysis. In the further part of the article, the division of pyrolysis can be found due to its speed and related differences in the content of individual products and the division of this type of thermal processes, due to the type of reactors used. In addition, the article presents the conditions for conducting thermal processes and their impact on the content of solid, gaseous and liquid products. The work presents the construction of reactors, the principle of their operation, as well as the advantages and disadvantages resulting from their use. In the further part of the article, microalgae are described as an efficient source of fuel in combination with other widely used products of plant origin. In the last part of this work, the composition of products obtained after pyrolysis of waste of various origins was compared.</p>",

This fact drives the search for modern technologies which are economically advantageous and environmentally friendly. A fuel cell technology is one of many solutions and hydrogen fuel cells are especially important. The essential element of such a cell is the electrolytic membrane which makes proton transfer possible.</p><p>In this article, selected examples of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that can be used as proton-conducting membranes are described. Porous structure of such materials as well as the existence of proton-donating and accepting groups on their pore walls allow for creation of hydrogen bonding network enabling the proton hopping (Grotthuss’s conduction mechanism). The conduction can also occur on the way of diffusion of bigger ions, e.g. H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (vehicular conduction mechanism)</p><p>Proton conducting MOFs can be divided according to temperature in which these materials can operate. There are two regimes – below 100°C – conductivity in MOFs is aided by the presence of water molecules, and above 100°C – conductivity does not depend on humidity. Important group among MOFs conductive under low-temperature conditions are oxalate-based frameworks. Taking into account synthetic methods, interesting case is the MOF reported by Matoga and co-workers, which was obtained on the way of economically and environmentally friendly mechanosynthesis.</p><p>High proton conductivity in metal-organic frameworks can be achieved not only when channels are filled with water molecules but also by introduction of non-volatile organic compounds to framework voids or by incorporating them into the framework. Imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, pyrazoline or histamine may play the role of such compounds. Remarkable examples of this strategy include the MOF reported by Kitagawa and co-workers, where 1,2,4-triazole molecules are incorporated into the framework as well as the material in which proton conduction occurs owing to the presence of imidazole guest molecules.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Sun is the most powerful source of clean, cheap and environmentally friendly source of energy, but still, the usage of this resource cover less than 1% of current world energy requirements [1]. However, nature realizes efficient conversion of solar energy to chemical energy on mass scale in different photoactivated processes like photosynthesis, which are essential for our life on this planet. The process takes place in green parts of plants with exceptional efficiency and precision. Natural photosystems like that attract attention to many researchers to develop artificial energy conversion devices. Many photoactive materials (polymers, nanostructures and small molecules) exhibiting high solar energy conversion and catalytic activity have been synthesized and rapidly applied in fields like pollutant removal [2] or solar cells [3]. Although significant development of artificial devices that can mimic natural processes have been achieved, their commercialization still remains a problem. Construction of molecular structure that can mimic natural photosystems is very challenging with regard to synthetic chemistry and impossibility of use the “top – down” methods which cannot reach the molecular level. Generally, photoactive materials have low stability and short lifetime due to their oxidative and aqueous degradation and decomposition under high intensity of light [4]. One of the most challenging problems during designing of artificial photosystems is directionality of excitation energy transfer along properly ordered chromophores. What is more, the mechanism of energy migration often cannot be described using well-known Förster or Dexter theories [5]. This work will focus on the selected artificial photosystems based on polymers. First, short theory of energy transport is presented, followed by description of devices based on multilayered films, repairable polymeric systems, nanohybrids of carbon nanotubes and photoactive polymers, light harvesting conjugated microporous polymers and polymer brushes.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>The chemometric methods of data analysis allow to resolve complex multi-component systems by decomposing a measured signal into the contributions of pure substances. Mathematical procedure of such decomposition is called empirical data modelling. The main aim and subject of this article is to provide some basic information on the chemometric analysis. </p><p>The chemometric techniques are divided into three categories, resulting from the assumed premises. A base of hard type of modelling is an assumption, that the measured dataset can be a priori described by generally accepted  physical or chemical laws, expressed by analytical forms of mathematical functions, however with unknown values of parameters [1]. Numerical values of those constants are optimised by using procedures such as the least squares curve fitting [1, 2]. When explicit form of equations are found, the whole system of data can be resolved. Therefore, the white types of data modelling are often used for kinetic measurements [3–8] and analysis of fluorescence quenching [9–13]. </p><p>Completely different approach to data modelling is offered by so called soft chemometric methods [14–20]. Those techniques do not require any presumptions; solutions obtained for the considered system are thus far much more unconstrained. The black types of analysis make use not only of the least squares fitting procedures [18, 19], but also some other geometrical optimisation algorithms [16, 17]. The results of that approach suffer however from one main drawback: the final outcome is not unique –  system is described by a set of feasible solutions. As a consequence, soft data modelling is generally applied to resolve empirical data, which cannot be easily expressed by an explicit form of a function. Such measurement techniques are for example chromatography or volumetry.  </p><p>However, if some conjecture could be made about the measurement system and  the obtained data, it is possible to stiffen the black methods by applying white constraints [20]. These types of the chemometric analysis are called grey or hard-soft, and are a practical combination of model-free optimisation with the limitations of feasible solutions, resulting from conformity with physical or chemical laws. </p><p>Due to the fact, that data modelling provides an opportunity for simultaneous identification of several components of the analysed mixture, the chemometric procedures, although not so popular yet, are extremely powerful research tools.</p>",

The most characteristic properties include the large surface area, strong chemical reactivity and tendency to agglomerate. Nanomaterials have wide applications in several disciplines, i.e. materials engineering, medicine and food technology. These materials have high potential in biomedical engineering thanks to increased biological activity when compared with the bulk material. Recent advances in nanotechnology are currently mostly focused on improvement of effective synthesis methods. Sonochemical irradiation is an effective technique for the synthesis nanoparticles. This method is widely used for inorganic nanoparticles production in contrast to organic ones, which could open powerful possibilities of creating bioactive, therapeutic or self-cleaning surfaces. </p><p>In principle, the introduction of a strong acoustic field into an aqueous solution induces acoustic cavitation. The nucleation, growth and collapse of the bubble during acoustic cavitation are graphically shown in Figure 1. When the bubble reaches a certain size it become resonant with ultrasonic radiation and rapidly increase in size. Then, the bubble becomes unstable and violently collapses. The collapse of microbubbles produces extremely high localized pressures and temperatures (hundreds bar and thousands K) which lead to hot spot. Conditions of sonochemistry are rather radical in comparison to other chemical processes. Moreover, the synthesis and simultaneously embedding nanoparticles into polymer surfaces are possible. </p><p>This paper constitutes a review of the recent literature in sonochemical synthesis of organic, bioactive nanoparticles. The introduction will focus on a short overview of sonochemistry, the next part will present the mechanism of formation nanoparticles using ultrasounds. Also, some advantages of sonochemistry as a tool for nanomaterials fabrication is presented. In the next section some examples of bioactive nanoparticles prepared in sonochemical reaction are listed and advantages of sonochemical synthesis are discussed.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Many of biochemical paths and processes require some metal ions to occur. There are also known the negative effects of the presence of metal ions in the orga­nism. The both sides of metal ions interactions on the living organism require specific regulations and cannot be left without supervision and control of the orga­nism itself. One of the strategy to keep the control on metal ions are cystein-rich proteins that play crucial role in detoxication of metal ions that are dangerous for human organism as well as they help to maintain homeostasis of essential metal ions. Matallothioneins are one of the well known, but still not fully understood, cysteine-rich proteins. They are small proteins but may contain up to 30% of cysteine residues in the sequence, and what makes them very special from chemical point of view - all of the thiols present there are reduced [1]. This property makes these proteins very tempting for coordination of various metal ions. The most efficient binding to metallothionein is observed for the ions belonging to a Group 11 and 12. Cu<sup>+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and C<sup>2+</sup> represent these metal ions [2]. Besides of the lack of disulfide bridges, metallothioneins show also the absence or low amount of aromatic amino acid residues in the sequence [1]. Studies of the metallothioneins and their isoforms among different organisms show that the position of cysteine residues is very conservative [3]. Considering this aspect of metallothionein structure, some specific motifs of cysteine residues arrangement can be found in the sequence of these proteins. Most of the common polythiol motifs are CXC, CXXC, CXXXC, CC – where C is a cysteine residue and X is random α-amino acid residue (other than cysteine) [3–5]. The influence of the cysteine residues organization on the specificity of metal ions binding was intensively studied. The differences observed for specificity of metal ions binding by metallothioneins and selected polythiol motifs are reviewed in this paper – with strong emphasis on the effect of the cysteine residues topography. </p>",

A wide spectrum of antibiotics and other low molecular compounds and their complexes with Cu2+ ions have been tested as potential inhibitors of the HDV ribozyme catalytic reaction. Unexpectedly, it has been found that a number of compounds, depending on the conditions, exhibit inhibitory or stimulatory properties, i.e. they act as modulators of the RNA catalysis process. It was found that the effect of stimulation / inhibition of the catalytic activity of the HDV ribozyme is closely related to the degree of protonation of the antibiotics under study in given conditions. Their ability to inhibit catalysis also increases after binding the Cu<sup>2+</sup> cation. In an environment with a higher pH, antibiotics usually stimulate the cleavage reaction, as at least some of their nitrogen centers are allowed to participate in the catalysis reaction, as proton acceptors / donors or a catalytic metal ion coordination site. During the study of one of the antibiotics, bacitracin, it was also observed that it exhibits nucleolytic properties with RNA and DNA molecules. The discovery of the hydrolytic properties of bacitracin extended the potential use of this antibiotic in antiviral therapy with the aim to destroy undesired nucleic acids in the cell. To search for DNAzymes catalyzing RNA hydrolysis, the in vitro selection method was used. In the selection experiment aimed at obtaining DNAzymes active in the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions, variants belonging to the family of DNAzymes 8–17 previously described in the literature were obtained. Analysis of their properties showed that not only Cd<sup>2+</sup> but also Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions support catalysis, therefore the site of catalytic metal ion coordination is not highly specific. The DNAzymes obtained in the second selection experiment showed an optimum of catalytic activity in the pH range of 4.0–4.5 and were inactive at a pH higher than 5.0. Interestingly, they do not require the presence of any divalent metal ions as cofactors in the catalysis reaction. The obtained results broaden the repertoire of DNAzymes which operate under non-physiological conditions and bring new information on the possible mechanisms of reactions catalyzed by nucleic acids.</p>",

The method used for the antibacterial susceptibility testing was broth microdilution, according to the CLSI – Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute – standard M11-A8; agar Schaedler, enriched with 50% LHB - Lysed Horse Blood, was used as a medium for culturing strains. The antibacterial activity increased for the immobilized antibiotics – HAp doped with metronidazole and tinidazole was six times more bactericidal than non-immobilised metronidazole for both clinical isolates. In comparison with non-immobilised tinidazole, HAp immobilised with tinidazole was six thousand times more effective against P. distasonis and two hundred times more effective ­against P. bivia. HAp doped with tetracycline was over two times more bactericidal than tetracycline non-immobilised (according to the literature data). The exact MIC for bionanocomposites of HAp and silver was not obtained. The research shows that bionanocomposites of hydroxyapatite are good drug carriers for both antibiotics and silver particles and ions. The use of bionanocomposites of apatite immobilised with antibiotics in dentistry could result in a prolonged antibacterial activity of these compounds.</p>",

Generally, the tiosemicarbazones coordinate to the metal centre by means of an (N,S) bidentate mode, and when an additional coordinating group is present, more diversified binding modes can occur such as a tridentate (X,N,S) coordination fashion. The stability of the metal complexes formed with the tiosemicarbazoness strongly depends on the character of the metal ion, the X-donor atom of the additional functional group and the position and type of the substituents at the tiosemicarbazones.</p><p>The most prominent representative of this family is the α(N)-heterocyclic Triapine (3-aminopyridine- 2-carbaldehyde thiosemicarbazone; 3-AP), which is currently undergoing different phase-I and -II clinical trials as an antitumor agent, and demonstrates promising activity. Triapine is a very strong inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate determining enzyme in the supply of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis required for cell proliferation. The mechanism of action involves most probably the formation of an iron(II)–Triapine complex, which reacts with molecular oxygen to result in the generation of reactive oxygen species. Subsequently, these reactive oxygen species are responsible for the quenching of the active-site tyrosyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase required for the enzymatic activity. As a result, the coordination chemistry of iron complexes of tiosemicarbazones has been receiving considerable attention. </p><p>This review describes the coordination chemistry of tiosemicarbazones, in particular analogs of Triapine. The coordination compounds of d-block elements are discussed with respect to their bonding and structures.

The metal-binding ability of STSC at physiological pH was compared and shown.</p><p>Further, various biological applications with emphasis an anticancer activity of the ligands/complexes are discussed in brief so as to indicate the importance of ligands under consideration. </p>",

Chemical modification of basic structure (nalidixic acid) has led to the development of a group of various compounds currently used in medicine. This article discusses the generation of quinolones, mode of their action, and relationship between activity and structure of these antibiotics. The most common quinolones, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin were discussed in details, also the therapeutic potential of newer agents was reviewed.</p><p>Recently, understanding of how molecular modifications among quinolone core structure can affect antimicrobial and anticancer activities has progressed rapidly. In this paper we discussed few examples of fluoroquinolone structural modifications. It was proved that many organic and inorganic compounds derived from fluoroquinolones overcame bacterial drug-resistance. Furthermore, chemical modification improved fluoroquinolone’s anticancer activities.  </p>",

This bacterium can migrate with blood to the different part of the human body e.g colon. The studies suggest participation of Fn in a colorectal cancer promotion, but a particular mechanism of this disease is still unclear. Colorectal cancer leads to million of new death cases each year. It is third in the worldwide in terms of mortality. The predictions for the coming years are not optimistic. The statistics encourage researchers to know the details of the mechanism of colorectal cancer. It is suggest, that outer membrane proteins of Fn are responsible for development of this disease. Transition metal ions such as Cu(I), Cu(II), Fe(II) can coordinate to proteins and generate free radicals by Fenton reaction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) destroy important biological macromolecules such as DNA, proteins or lipids and cause different diseases. The paper presents characteristics of Fn and its outer membrane proteins, description of copper(II) complexes and their ability to ROS generation.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>Peptides are crucial ligands for transition metal ions and form complexes with them, that can have important biological activity. Many factors impact on the creation of complexes such as: protection of amine group from N-terminal or carboxylate group from C-terminals of the protein, the presence of noncoordinating and coordinating side chains in the peptide sequence, the number of histidyl residues and their location in the peptide chain. In complexes the metal ion can be bound bound by various donor atoms from amino acids residues (e.g. nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur). In general, the protection of N- or C-terminal groups influences the less stable formation of complexes. Stable complexes are created, if the free amine group from the N-terminal is involved in the coordination process. Peptides with noncoordinating side chains include alanine or glycine. Glycine complexes are more stable than these with alanine. Histidyl residue is the most effective amino acid residue in binding metal ions. The amine group of the lysyl residue, thiol from cysteine or carboxylate from aspartyl or glutamyl residues are also functional groups that coordinate metal ions. The coordination process is initiated by a group that anchors metal ion. A free amine group from N-terminus or imidazole nitrogen are the best examples of anchor groups. The metal ions can also be bound through amide nitrogens, after their forced deprotonation by the anchor group and formation of chelate rings. Peptides containing two or more histidyl residues exhibit high structural diversity in the complexes formation. In addition, these peptides can also form macrochelates and polynuclear complexes. The location of amino acid residues in the peptide chain (especially histydyl residue) also results in the thermodynamically stable formation of complexes.</p>",

            "abstract": "<p>High sensitivity, accuracy, and ability to provide structural information makes mass spectrometry (MS) the method of choice for both qualitative and quantitative analysis in proteome research. Peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was successfully applied to discover new peptide sequences and modifications. Insufficient ionization of some peptides is one of the main limitations of ­MS-based peptide identification. The development of sensitive detection techniques for the efficient analysis of such samples is very important. Differences in ionizability cause difficulties in quantification studies, which could be overcome by derivatization of peptides to improve both the detectability and the selectivity of an analysis. Incorporation of ionization markers and isotopic labels (particularly the isobaric tags) is often used for this reason. Isobaric labeling reagents (including commercially available iTRAQ, TMT, DiLeu and DiART) have found a wide application in quantitative proteomics. </p><p>Mass spectrometry is a very good tool for the determination of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), but the modified proteins are usually present in low concentrations. The development of ionization tags specific to a particular PTM and suitable for sensitive analysis of the modified proteins is required. For the analysis of phosphorylated peptides, a combination of β-elimination and the reaction of resulting α,β-dehydroamino acid residues with the nucleophilic thiol group could be used to detect a labile PTM. Such reaction may be used to introduce derivatizing reagents at the original site of phosphorylation, to enhance ionization in MS analysis. Glycation and glycosylation of proteins are other very important PTMs associated with many natural processes as well as diseases. We have designed and synthesized bifunctional quaternary ammonium salt derivatives of phenylboronic acids for selective detection of carbohydrates and peptide-derived Amadori pro­ducts by ESI-MS. </p><p>The attachment of a fixed charge (e.g. in a form of a quaternary ammonium salt) to the amino groups in peptides leads to the enhancement of a precursor ion signal in mass spectra. We have developed several new QAS-containing ionization reagents including bicyclic tags with DABCO, ABCO or azoniaspiro groups. It is worth noting that 2,4,6-substituted pyrylium salts react with amino groups in peptides introducing a stable positive charge and improve peptide detection by MS. </p><p>The newly developed ionization tags were successfully applied for the analysis of OBOC combinatorial libraries as well as for studying possible biomarkers of preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder.</p>",
